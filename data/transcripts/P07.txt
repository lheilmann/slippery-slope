So this feels very turgid. It feels very slimy and thick. I can feel my hands are sweaty, but the surface is also very resistant, more resistant than a surface can be. And there's a slight sensation of pulsing, not major. It's telling me you're not welcome. It tells me that I'm in a hard zone that I'm stuck in the mud. Frustrated. Slow. Sludgy.
It's undulating. I can sense something trailing behind me. There's a primary fuzz, and then it trails behind and somehow. It feels like a few different points of contact were sparkles of it. So it's slightly sparkly, a bit like the crackling of sparks. Mystical. With some depth. A charming guy. Deep voice. Wonder, I think, is something. Deep thought. Introspection. Slowness. Calm.
It feels a bit similar to the others. It has that slight sweaty feel but much lighter and much thinner. It feels like a small string of droplets, a very tiny string of droplets. Drumming my fingers. The pecking of a small bird. A millipede marching around, a really tiny millipede. Maybe erotic excitement, like that shiver that you get in excitement. Buzzy. Anxious. Light. Indeterminate. Flattery.
This feels somehow like deeper below my fingers, I guess, going deeper. This sensation feels like it's in the glass a bit further. It has a strange rhythm to it. It's almost like a heartbeat of some sort. There's the buzz, and then there is some kind of app below. [onomatopoeia]. It feels a bit like the sound of a base outside of a club where you can feel it on these surfaces around you because it has the melodic aspect to it, like a sense of complexity, which sounds like it's been produced by a human. It's some kind of variance to it.
This feels like lots of small balls. There's just a lot of balls falling, small balls falling. It reminds me of a lottery where you have little balls running around. And then they all fall down towards the end. I guess a sense of falling. It could be a joyous occasion of sorts, like a party. You're at a party. The champagne is flowing. People are chatting. There's a bubbliness in the air. It just feels like lots of smooth surfaces intermittently making contact with my finger, just like [onomatopoeia], a bit like those metal pin things which you put in your face and you can make your face --. Imagine all those pins just randomly come into contact with your finger.
This sounds like a marching band drummer and a paradiddle. I think it's called where you go [onomatopoeia]. It feels a bit fun. It obviously has a rhythmic component to it, which is peculiar. It's funny. A posh chap who is a bit silly and a bit flippant. He floats around and says lots of little nothings and keeps people entertained in that way.
This one is like a straight-up dagger. It makes me think of these dagger waves, sawtooth, whatever, chainsaw. It's just constant and angular. Quick, fast-paced, but not aggressive. Being wired. You've had caffeine, but you don't have any natural energy. You're just like [onomatopoeia]. It's not unpleasant. It's not attached to what I would say is an anxious feeling, but it is like this feeling of artificial energy. It feels somewhat warm. It feels like when I put pink noise at night for me to relax, to go to bed, of sorts, but I still have some energy.
This one is almost melodic. It feels similar to the paradiddle one where you can sense it has a very particular rhythm like [onomatopoeia]. It's more meditative and a bit deeper than the paradiddle one. It feels a bit thicker and a bit more like there is ambiance to it. It made me think of being at a club with house music, and it has that more kind of deep house, maybe. There's this kind of ambiance and this warmth to it. It's the same rhythm that goes around and around and around. It feels less dispersed than the other ones. It feels like it's one surface which is making contact. It's like everything which my finger is touching is receiving the sensation rather than like lots of different points. And it feels more like a larger body.
This is a very obvious pulsing rhythm, which makes me think of an alarm like the alarms that were in Metal Gear Solid, like a factory-wide alarm by some security system over a big industrial plant. I wouldn't say it's aggressive like that, but it has that length and that dispersion, which makes me think of that, but it's milder. Insistent. Ebbing. Broad. Spacious. It's telling me to take note of something. It's something I should pay attention to, but nothing that's necessarily dangerous or alarming, but of importance to the sense of a better foreboding maybe.
This sounds really chirpy, like birds frolicking around in a nervous fashion and playing with each other because they have too much energy. They need to get rid of, come off with. Incessant. Nerves, in a positive sense, like excitement, but also laced with that nervousness of something energy that needs to be discharged. It reminds me of being a kid. I'm playing around with other children and being excited by them, but also a little bit afraid but just like with too much energy to spare.
This one was harder to understand. There's a sweatiness and slight pulsing. It feels like a really big ragtag ball rolling over yourself. And it doesn't seem to be that much consistency. It feels many-sided. I thought of some sort of rolling animal, and I was thinking of it. I forgot what cartoon it was, but there is this ant-eater-type looking thing with a long snout, which would roll itself in and roll around spaces. But generally big, fat, with lots of strange angles and subsections.
It feels brittle. It feels like a material which doesn't have much substance to it, which feels like glass. It can fracture in many ways but also is quite fine and complexly shaped, fragile. I am stepping on eggshells. I have to be careful here. Stepping on ice. Touching something delicate.
This feels like buzzing, similar to the other sawtooth. It feels a bit faster and less deep, more shallow. Constant background noise. Someone with a work ethic, which just goes and does things and has this consistency to their action. And there is low-level determination without drama. It's that running, but not running in the moment, that running over many days and just the action of incorporating running into your life. And so, if you were to imagine doing it for a few months and as a committed action.
So this is also pulses. The immediate impression is like a submarine. It feels a bit underwater, a bit gloopy, a bit muffled. It sounds a bit like bubbles. It sounds like I'm hearing medium-sized, manmade metallic structures passing through the water. Ambivalence, but not particularly angst provoking ambivalence but just like ambivalence that's bordering on indifference.
This one's very hard to distinguish. It's like my fingers are sweaty, but maybe there's more buzziness when I do it. It doesn't feel like there's any current. For the other ones, I could feel a specific current. But this just feels like sweaty glass but met with rattling more when I slide across. Yes, it's almost ticklish. A bit confused. Maybe a bit frustrated.
Tanker. Is this the same one? Again, it feels very similar to just having very sweaty fingers on a pane of glass. It's hard to notice anything very specific about whether there is a current. Now. That's interesting. That makes me think furry. It makes me think I'm handling a hamster. Small and furry. And it's very mild-tempered, curled up in itself. And it's vibrating in an anxious but charming manner. Coziness. Warmth. Sanctuary. Safety.
