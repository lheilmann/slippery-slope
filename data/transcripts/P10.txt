It's a pleasant feeling, but it has these little abrupt stops in the pattern. Yes, compared to some of the other sensations I had in the training, I would say this feels more as if you would have slightly sweaty fingers and you were touching on a piece of glass. So this is more akin to that feeling, though not completely the same, but it feels like that. So at times, I feel like it can be a little difficult to distinguish between whether it's actually the glass or if it's the sensation. I don't know because I would say maybe it's too subtle to really grab my attention. I would say. Now I'm just thinking aloud. So let's say it was a notification or something that tried to catch my attention, then I would feel like it was a little bit underwhelming, but maybe for other things, it might work better. It feels okay. I will say again. In the vibration patterns going up and down, as I said before, it feels they're these small, little abrupt stops between the oscillation, which again feels like it's a super subtle feeling. But yet still, it has this edginess to it or this sharp stop edginess to it. It's the best way I can describe it.
I would say this one here is a little bit harder to feel. I would say it feels like a rugged, uneven surface, almost like if you were to touch something like a brick wall or something, something that's just a little uneven. I would describe it as a person, that is. I don't know. I guess I would at least describe it as a person who would not have smooth skin. I don't know what kind of connotations that would bring up. I don't know.
This one here feels like it has a little bit more pattern to it. It's almost rhythmic in a sense. Yes, I would say, for instance, music. For instance, that could be a chord progression or a baseline of something, something that has sort of a rhythm to it that changes. It feels good. I would say it sort of speaks to my brain the same way that hearing a chord progression or a bass line or something like that in music will do, like something that you can follow along to. Yes, that same area of the brain being activated, almost.
This one here feels a bit harsher. I would say it's more warning. If I were to compare this to another modality like sound, for instance, I would say, if you do something on the computer and you are unsuccessful in your action, you will get a sound or something that kind of communicates something went wrong instead of some, I don't know, rising pitch sound. This is more like something didn't go as you would have expected it to go. I don't know. Unsuccessfulness. Try again feeling, if that makes any sense.
I would say maybe a little bit it reminds me of some of the actions that my Apple Watch does. So again, in comparison to some music sounds where you might have something that goes up in pitch or down in pitch to signify something, the Apple Watch does the same thing with vibration, where it will go up in vibration pitch and down in vibration pitch to communicate something. This feels like it's coming in these waves of vibration in the same way but more monotone. Yes, it feels like these waves or a surge of vibration that comes on and off and like an on-off pattern. So something that signifies something that is a binary state. It's there, or either it's not there. On-off. No, I can't come up with any adjectives.
I would say this one here is more coarse, especially in relation to the other one. It sort of feels like the vibration pattern is more spread out than the other one was. Again, I would say I like this coarse feeling. But what I think where you could really harness the strength of this feeling would maybe be in combination with something like the one previous to this one. You could, instead of having this coarse vibration pattern, then have something that moves from coarse to more fine-grained over time interval to communicate change more or less. If I had to put an adjective on this one here, I would say static. Not in a bad way, but it's just a static feeling of some coarse vibration pattern.
Sharpness. More needles stabbing. It's like this prickly sensation if your hairs start to rise in the back of your neck, sort of feeling, I would say. I don't know. Getting kissed in the back of the neck or something. I don't know. It's like this weird space between pleasure and pain. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's a clearly nice or pleasant feeling, but yet still, it's very distinct. I'm not going to say it's painful or anything because it's not, but it's just very stabby. I don't know. It causes arousal in some way.
I would say maybe just to describe what I'm feeling also. This feels like longer bursts of vibrations. And to me, what it sort of signifies is, I don't know, something that's activated or something that's ongoing or in live progress. That's what it's telling me. I would characterize it as someone who is, I wouldn't say, hard-working, necessarily, but someone who is sticking to their guns and doing what they're told. They will get up every morning and do their thing and do what they're supposed to do.
It's very subtle. It almost feels like it's pulsing. Maybe it's just the way that I touch it. It's like some of the other ones. I don't know why I keep returning to this word stabby, but it's just the sensation of it being. The attack of the sound is quite hard, and it's decaying quite fast. So it comes on really quickly, and it leaves really quickly. So it's not like the sine wave. It's not really like a slow beat, but it's very up and down.
This one here is more pronounced than the other one. I would say this here is one of the more attention-grabbing ones that I've felt so far. I would assume that it would be able to take or catch my attention more easily than some of the other ones. And I think one of the reasons why that is is because it feels like there is more spacing between the vibrations as opposed to some of the other ones where it's it's a really, really sudden sound, sorry, a really, really subtle vibration. The frequency of them coming on is also very close together that it can just mud together almost where here I'm actually truly able to feel each and every vibration very clearly. It makes me feel like this is something that I need to look towards, or this is something that I need to pay attention to, like this is something of importance.
So this one here is quite similar to the other one, just with even more spacing. And I would say it's in the same vein as the other one. There is a lot of the same things that hold true to this one here. I would say, however, that because the vibration pattern is spread out to this degree, it might feel maybe a little too sporadic. Yes, I would say maybe like a heartbeat almost. Let me just, one, two, three, four. So that's quite a high beat per minute for a heartbeat. But somebody who might be a little winded. Relaxation. I would say or something of lower physical effort, something like that.
This one here is a little harder to distinguish, but I got it. So I would say with this one, here again, it has a high attack and a quick decay. There's a lot of spatial separation between the oscillations, and I would say, maybe even to the extent that I would have a hard time naturally distinguishing this as something that I would pay attention to. I guess, just intuitively, I would be in doubt as to whether this is just something that happens to me by chance or if this is actually something that is directed towards me. I would say somebody who is a little scattered in their life. Things are maybe not so much under control, and they might be living in bursts and then just completely, I don't know, disappear and go away for some time, and then they just come back full force.
Okay. This one here feels a little bit more muddy than the other ones, I'd say. In that, the attack, like the onset and the decay, is a little bit weaker than some of the other ones. I would say maybe an engine like a motor that's just running in idle, just standing, being on without actually going anywhere, but just standing there. Or maybe like an old steam train that's just standing there, waiting at the platform ready to go. I would associate it with something that's going in a very uniform pace in the same linear direction. Yes, something that's very syncopated.
I would say it feels like dance music almost. It has a really high beat frequency if you can call it that. So like fast-paced music. And also because, again, I would say the onset of this one is a little bit higher. So it's more of the thumping sound that it gives off while still being in a high bpm. This is telling me that something is working at a fast pace. Yes, it's definitely attention-grabbing. I can't really specify what or what kind of feelings it brings with it other than it grabs my attention, not in a bad way or not in a good way. It's a neutral way, I'd say. It feels like something you might be drawn to look towards.
So first of all, I would say, again, it feels a little bit more muddy in the sense that the vibration pattern is not as clearly defined or distinctively on-off if you'd say. It's more wavy in that sense. I would say, especially with something like this, where the sensation is so subtle, to begin with, you really have to feel to try to distinguish it. If I had to focus on other things while doing this, I think I would have a hard time allocating enough cognitive energy towards actively distinguishing this pattern here. I would say it makes me feel indifferent, almost. I don't know. It just doesn't really invoke anything special in me as opposed to a lot of the other ones. This one here feels just feels a little bit more indifferent.
Okay. I don't really seem to be feeling anything, a little bit, maybe. Let's go with it. I would describe it as maybe a vibrator, almost like it's as opposed to some of the other ones that have this very fast onset and very quick decay as well. This is more of just a quick, vibrating feeling. There's just a continuous vibration. A vibrator. It feels like it's ticklish. Now that I can feel it better, it feels like it travels up the arm. It's a nice sensation actually, very pleasant. It's telling me. I don't know. I don't know if it's telling me anything specifically. It just leaves me with this sensation of pleasantness. I don't really feel that it conveys any message as such other than a purely hedonistic feel of something that feels good. Whereas some of the other examples where I said like this could be a notification, something very sharp that grabs my attention or communicates something's going on. This is more just a static, nice feeling, I would say.
