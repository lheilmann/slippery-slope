Yes, it's very mild in a sense. It's like a small buzzing that goes on. No, not particularly. I think it's just a more gentle soft sort of vibration. I don't know if you have a bee buzzing in your ear, but imagine that as a sensation. I don't know. I can think of like blue sort of colors is what I would associate with it. No, I don't know, just my phone, I guess. Yes, that's it.
Okay, this seems a little more subtle than the other one. Yes, it reminds me of a pulse maybe, more like a pulse than like a buzzing sort of thing. It feels very light, lighter than the previous one. Yes, it's almost like I have to pay attention to the sensation before I can feel it. I don't know. I have to focus a lot more and pay attention. I don't know, like space and pulse and flashes of red. Very stoic and that not as expressive.
Okay, I feel like I don't feel anything so very, very slightly. Yes, it seems very light. Yes, I can barely feel anything. Yes, it's almost like I'm feeling only the glass.
I think I'm going to change my finger and see because I don't think I'm feeling anything. Yes, it just feels like the glass.
Yes, this feels like it's pulling me towards it. I don't know. Yes, the more vibration that sort of sucks you in. It's like falling from the sky and in the gravity acts on you. It feels like little buzzes on my finger. I don't know, not particularly. It feels like when I'm doing a curl or something like that. It's like when you're painting, and you want to do a full stop. This feels like a nice full stop. I don't know, a little eccentric, and maybe it would be a little quirky, would say things directly. Yes, sometimes when you just want to not be politically correct and just say whatever you want to say.
Okay, this is very, I don't know, subtle. I think of drawing dotted lines for some reason. I don't know. It just reminds me of this game that you play where you have to keep slicing things into half. It just reminds me of the dotted line from the game. Yes, slicing and breaking things down. It's like a starting and stopping sort of sensation. I don't know like I'm in a car that I'm trying to learn, but I'm starting and stopping and that sort of memory.
Yes, this feels different. It's pulsing, but like, more slowly and with deeper impact. I can feel it a little stronger. I didn't know, sort of like superior and like a dragon or something. I don't know. I'm assuming this is what it feels like when you want to feel the vibrations of a motor or something like that. So I feel like I can feel the vibrations. No, not any particular emotion. I'm just feeling overwhelmed, maybe.
This feels like there's something going on underground. It's like five minutes before an earthquake where you might feel the vibrations, but it's not as intense. There's a potential danger that's sort of coming. I would be very cautious. I would be very like think about twice before I say anything. I don't know. I have to be a little more risk-averse and put my guards up. Yes, I don't know. It feels light on my finger but also feels like there's a lot more impact to wait after from.
This feels like small tiny signals. I don't know. If you could feel radio signals or TV signals in the air, this is probably what it would, I'm assuming, feel like. Yes, very small and subtle. It makes me feel like this is something I can control, and within my control, I can access it. I would say like subordinates like an army or something that I can manipulate if that makes sense. It feels very light. Yes, it barely touches my skin, so I don't feel it's impactful.
I don't know. I'm assuming if we can touch electricity, this is how it will probably feel, slight sparks. It makes me think of electric lines like these giant ones in fields. No, just like these radar pulse guns that they use to measure speed, if that makes sense. I don't know. I can definitely feel it beyond just my skin, like I can feel it on my entire finger. It reminds me of EDM somehow, like the bass and reverberating. I don't know, just nice to feel sensations and a little more grounded to the feeling.
I don't know if I'm feeling anything. Is this going to change? Yes, I don't think I'm feeling anything. Yes, I just feel the glass.
Yes, this feels like slight resistance, sort of a thing. So it feels like there's something that's moving against the direction that I'm going in. Yes, it also is like underneath it, like the sandworms in Dune. You can feel them going against the direction that you're going in. Yes, I feel like I'm touching like ridges soft, like animals tack or something like that like scales and things like that. I don't know. It's someone who's very rebellious against the establishment sort of thing. I feel very tired after fighting so long with somebody is something that I would attach to this. I don't know, like keep moving on.
This is interesting. It feels like there's nothing, but there's actually something going on. It feels more like something in the air. They're not the finger in the skin that's touching the glass. Yes, it feels like vibrations in the air. Yes, I would say when you're cycling in Copenhagen, and the wind's against you, and then it's on your face. It's nice. It makes me feel surrounded. I think I feel it more on my hand or your knuckles more than my fingertips.
This feels very slow, like the slow-motion videos of like a waterfall or like water on a river or something like that like very at its own pace. It's telling me I can't try to control time. It has its own rhythm. I don't know. It's like I try to move faster, but it's still going at its own pace. I would say I'm feeling a little helpless because no matter how fast I move, I think the feeling is just sort of slower. I don't know. It's just some very smooth vibrations on my fingertips.
It's like faster vibrations. I don't know. Have you seen tractors on the farm that just make a lot of vibrations, and then they're just passing by. That would be it. The sensation is not too heavy. It's just that the vibrations are fast. If you're on a highway and then you hear something go by really fast. I don't know, maybe anxiety a little because it's like fast vibrations and anxious thoughts. Yes, it just feels like it's not rough, but it's faster on my fingertips, like something running across on my fingertips.
This feels like a build-up to something like at a song when the bass drops and then you're building down to the base drop, or you're building up to the peak. I don't know what it's telling me. I think it's just like chug along, get ready, sort of like preparation stage, I would say. I think it's like someone's digging on my skin. I'd say that's pretty much it. It's nice and rhythmic. Yes, maybe when I'm falling asleep. It's sort of repetitive patterns that make you want to fall asleep like a hard worker. I would definitely say this is someone who works very hard every day might not be the smartest person, but it's definitely the hard-working person in the room.
