On this finger, I can feel tiny little, very light bumps, but super, super light. Not bringing up many feelings, more annoyance that I can't feel it, but I think I've got quite calloused fingers. It's weird that I can't feel it on those two. Feels like a stubbly beard, but like the day after shaving.
Yes, nothing on those two fingers again. It almost feels like it's not as continuous as the last one. The last one was like tiny little footsteps. This is more of like a skip. Like a very faint heartbeat, if you were testing somebody. Quiet because I can barely feel it. Yes, just like a mousy person that doesn't really have much to say, but a child, definitely a child. A quiet child that is skipping around a playground.
I think this one is even fainter than the first two. It is so hard to know whether it's the screen or --. Don't really feel like I'm feeling anything. There might be a slight buzz. The first one was like somebody who's doing tiny steps. The second one was like skipping. This is even more continuous than steps like a razor or something, but super, super light because I'm not even sure if I'm really feeling anything. Not much, because I can't feel it. Nothing, I think. I would be trying to make something up here because I am really not feeling much.
What's wrong with my fingers? Again, absolutely nothing that time. No.
Once again, I don't think I feel anything on any of the fingers. Maybe like a very light vibration on my pinkie, but I could be imagining it because I want to.
Nothing on the first or second. Maybe I feel something super, super light again. Feels like running my finger over glass, but with a little bit more friction, I guess, like little tiny bumps. There is tiny, tiny, not even sand, smaller than sand on it, possibly. Yes, reminds me of running your finger through sand for some reason.
Nothing on the first finger. This one is super light again. Is there maybe pulses that are far apart? They're not really just one wide gap between each pulse, I think, but super light, quite hard to detect. Certainly not on my first two fingers, but I'm getting something maybe on my third and on my pinky. Nonexistent, it really doesn't feel like it's there. I guess I used this analogy already, but like a very slow heartbeat like [onomatopoeia] with little tiny vibration on it. [onomatopoeia]. Maybe it's a dying bee. Sad.
Nothing on the first. Nothing on the second. No, I don't think I'm getting anything at all this time. No, I've got nothing to say on that. It's nothing there.
Okay, it seems I've got a numb first finger because there's nothing happening there. Not much going on with the second. No, I don't think I'm really getting anything.
No, not much going on with first or second. No. Feels like maybe there is a very, very light, similar to one of the ones from the first half, like very continuous buzz, but very very light once again. Or is it continuous? Yes, not much happening there but just very, very light buzz. 
Nothing on my first finger. Nothing on second. No, I don't think I'm getting anything again. It's less continuous than the last one, a little bit bumpy, but super, super light once again. Yes, not much to say on it because I can barely feel it. A little bit gravelly.
Nothing on first. Nothing on second. Feels like this one is maybe like another pulsing one, perhaps. It's like [onomatopoeia] but once again super light, can't really feel it. I don't know. I don't love it for some reason. It doesn't feel super good. I can definitely feel it a bit more now that I'm touching it more. Yes, it's grand. I wouldn't be annoyed if this was on my phone. I don't know if I'd feel it if it was on my phone. I would describe it as a gentle buzz, pulsing, that goes on and off and on and off, and it's not continuous.
Okay, I'm getting this on my pinky for sure. It feels like going over speed bumps. If you were an ant --. That doesn't make any sense. Not a normal person's speed bump --. An ant going over ant-sized speed bumps. Not us going over us-sized speed bumps for some reason. It's very, very small the sensation, but it is bumpy. I like it more than the last one. I didn't love the gaps in the last one. The gaps made me uncomfortable for some reason. It feels like it's bumpy, so I guess there is technically gaps, but obviously, they're closer together. Yes, I could vibe with this one. Yes, but I don't know what. It's really hard to recall sensations. Do you know whenever you start getting your blood taken, and you can feel your blood in your finger? You've got that little thing that clips on. It feels like that. But it doesn't feel like taking someone's heartbeat. I don't know. 
Okay, nothing there on the first finger. Nothing on second. So hard to tell the difference between the glass and the sensations. Yes, getting something on my pinky finger. This feels definitely more intense than the last one. Is it like a longer one and then a shorter one or something? Feels like that. Or is it just one? [onomatopoeia]. Yes, this one's okay. It feels like there's more manic. There's more beats in it. Do you know whenever you're playing Xbox or Playstation, and you crash into something, or somebody shoots you, it vibrates? Feels like that. It's telling me that I've just been shot or that I've crashed into something. I'm associating it with that memory.
Nothing on my first finger. Nothing on second. Nothing on third. Okay, definitely getting something super light. Feels like there's big gaps between it. Only when I change direction, maybe it does something. Feels super light. This feels like a very chilled-out one. Like you're taking a stroll on the beach. I don't know what vibrates on a beach. Your phone vibrates in your pocket or something like relax; we're having a good time.  Somebody that is a bit of a stoner and is giving deep thoughts for some reason. I don't know why. But it just feels like a chill-out, like whatever, we're just hanging out. Just chilled out, having a good time.
Maybe something on the first two. Yes, there's my pinky picking something up. Definitely got something. I don't like this one. Why? It feels uneven. The vibrations just aren't equal to each other, and that just doesn't feel good. It's more intense than the others, but not in a nice way. Nothing springing to mind. I'm not having a good time, I would say. Bad. I'm not sad. I'm not angry. What's a bad emotion? Annoyance; get yourself together. Why are you so on even? Yes, someone who is sloppy, messy. I'm annoyed at you. And you're making me uncomfortable.
