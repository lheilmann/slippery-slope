So it feels like very steady, little beats, almost like playing ping pong with a tiny little ball. But it feels like a bit of a delay kind of beat, like it doesn't feel like it's a very fast tempo matching like any speed I'm at. It's just like a slow, drawn-out little beat. I think it makes me feel energetic because it's a bit jumpy, bouncy. And it's a very exciting, positive kind of beat. Playing ping pong. I don't know why. It feels good because it's not a constant kind of vibration. It's up and down, up and down, so it makes me feel a bit more engaged with the glass and the screen.
This is a very gentle beat. It's probably the hardest I've, from the warm-up, experienced beyond distinguishing between the friction of the glass and my finger. It's almost something I have to concentrate on to be able to feel properly. It's a very constant sensation. I can almost forget about it if I just keep my finger on the glass for too long, forget that it is there. Bland. Boring. Not very interesting. I  don't really get much out of this sensation, so I think it makes me less invested. And if it was a person, it would probably be someone I wouldn't be interested in talking to. It's almost like being at the beach and just running my hands through the sand if the sand was a bit colder. It doesn't have any rhythm to it, so I think that's why.
This is a soft vibration, but it's got a beat to it, so it's more fun. I'm spinning on a DJ set. Yes, disco. I think jamming a jam, like a jam session. It feels really gentle, soft, but also really energetic, or not energetic, like soft, gentle but connected. So just relax, chill out, have a good time, almost like being in a bodega with a good group of friends, and the music's not too heavy, but you know you're having fun. It's just like a really feel-good kind of music and environment. And it's not really a consistent beat, which probably made me think of being more social.
I don't really like this feeling. It's a bit haphazard. It's almost like a siren, but it's really soft. It's almost like a warning kind of feeling for some reason. I don't know why, but it makes me feel like there's danger coming. It's ominous but not something I can say I felt before, maybe just like feelings I am getting from watching movies and being in a barrack or something. I feel it could be this [onomatopoeia]. Footsteps are coming. Ominous. Suspenseful. Thrilling. Danger is encroaching. Haphazardous. Slippery. It's gripping and then slipping. I think that's why it's making me feel a bit uncomfortable.
This is interesting because it's like a small, slight vibration, and then you got a big vibration. It reminds me of my vibrator, so I would say sexual. But maybe interesting because I'm sure there's a pattern to that big vibration, but it almost feels like it's not because you get lost between the small one. And then the big one. So exciting. It makes me want to keep putting my finger across the screen. Exciting. Interesting. Evoking.
I can't really figure out what's going on with this one. There's something, and then it stops. Okay, there's a pattern. It's like a steady beat, and then it stops and then starts again, which is a bit irritating because I can feel like I'm getting into the pattern, and then it stops, and then I've lost the sensation, and then it starts again. Irritated. I'm anticipating something, and then I don't get it. Yes, it's a bit drawn out. I don't know if you can say all this. It is a setting on the vibrator that is really irritating because it makes you climax, and then it stops. Yes. Not consistent. But it is, but it's not. I don't know.
That's weird. It's almost really impossible to tell if --. It's almost like running your finger along something, and it is getting caught like a very rough surface. It makes me feel like it's more the surface rather than the vibration. I think it's telling me something's broken. I don't know. I'm really struggling to figure out the pattern in this. It feels like it's almost like when there is the vibration or feeling, it shouldn't be there. This is kind of strange and peculiar. I think it's maybe when you are daydreaming, and you're just doing things mindlessly. It's the kind of feeling where you get lost in that sensation of your finger to the glass. And then you get that vibration. And then you're like, I'm not focusing. I'm not concentrating and then maybe confused.
This is cool. I like this one. This is very interactive, like skipping, going for a walk, like an excited mood, like hopping alone. I don't literally hop when I'm excited and go for walks. I would feel it's something that it reminds me of. Do you remember being a kid and you had those xylophones? It's like a xylophone kind of sensation, really light up-beat. Really interactive. Really playful. Groovy and fun. I'm speaking between the glass, like there's something behind the glass, like someone's communicating through the glass, actually. I don't know.
It almost feels like this sensation is based on the amount of pressure I'm putting on this glass, but I know it's probably not. It almost feels like it's me and not the signal. I'm like in control. I don't know. It feels like it's coming from me because I can't really figure out a pattern or anything. So it messes with my head thinking that if I press harder, I'm going to feel something more. But I'm not. But I am. I don't know. Maybe unsettled. Because I feel like it's me doing something, but it's not me doing something. So I feel like I've lost control when I said the feeling was making me feel in control. But at the end, I'm just feeling insecure about what is happening. At the Science Museum, there's those things with the purple electric lights, and then you come closer to it, and then you can feel it, and then you move away, and you can't feel it. But it's almost with a delayed reaction. That's why I think those sensations are coming from me.
This is quite light, fluffy, almost like running my hands on a dog or something fluffy. It makes me feel quite comforting. Soft. Furry. Cushiony. Not velvety per se, but it's quite light. Comforting and sweet and cuddly. Giving my dog a hug. Petting my dog while she's cuddling next to me. It's almost like a little heartbeat of an animal where you just feel it. I don't know.
This is like a heartbeat. This is literally like a heartbeat. It's almost like I'm lying next to someone, and their heart's beating. It's making me feel freaked out. If I close my eyes, I could be putting my hand on someone's chest rather than it's actually glass. So I am a bit shocked but astounded. Yes, just leaving next to someone, rubbing my hand on their chest, and you can feel their heartbeat. I'm feeling close to someone.
This one feels like I'm putting my hands through something not quite as light as water, but something a bit more vicious and just put on my hands through slime. I feel rubbery slime, that kind of bounce back, but also liquid sensation. I'm not sure if I'm really getting a message out of it. It's almost more just the sensation if I was to be playing a game. It'll be more like a fun, playful kind of interaction.
It's like skating, like ice skating, and when you like to slide along the ice, it's like [onomatopoeia]. Quite nice. Quite like gliding. And relaxing. I think because it's such a long sensation in beat, it's making me feel really calm. Really empathetic because it's almost like the glass is listening to me and being patient with me. I'm just feeling it out. So I would say the person would be a person I would want to talk to and talk deeply with.
This is a little bit more electric. Maybe a bit anxious, just because it's a bit more of an electric feeling. The gaps between the sensation are further apart. So it's making me feel a bit almost like the sensation shouldn't be there on the glass, but it is. And it's almost like I touched it, and it's a bit electric, and that's weird.
This is quite fun because it's a very constant beat, and it makes me want to keep touching the glass. I could almost think that there would be music playing. If somebody told me that I'm deaf and I'm listening to a song, I'd be like. I know this song. I could tell you what the song is. It makes me feel familiar with this beat. Up-beat. Connected. Having fun. It's very exciting and stimulating, and evolving. I would say stimulating is what I think of the most. Or bringing back to the sensation of like if you were at a party and then you're feeling the vibration of a speaker, and you're just like, this gets me going. This gets me in the mood to party.
I don't know if I'm saying this because I am still on that party vibe. It's more like being against a speaker and hearing the beat of a song but not as upbeat. It's more like when you are at a concert, and there's an in-between act, and it's so silent, and they're just playing that music while nothing is happening, but they just want something to be playing. Ominous or shady. I'm not sure if I could really trust them. They're constantly being a bit hooded and not that open and a bit keeping to themselves. Maybe a bit like threatened and wary.
