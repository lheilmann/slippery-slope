It feels gentle, like I'm petting or touching something or someone like a dog or a person. It gives me the sensation or feeling of caring, I guess. Intimacy. Affection. Love. Appreciation. It's telling me to be soft, to go easy on what I'm touching. I would describe this as purring like a cat.
This reminds me of riding a rusty bike. When you're pedaling, there's something rusty about the bike. It's just difficult. I would describe this as daunting, almost perseverance in a way to make you work harder than you have to. It's a little bit ticklish. I think it's more the rhythm for me that is making me feel that way. But the actual feeling is good. It's not a bad feeling. The touch reminds me of your stomach growling. This makes me think of a drunk guy at a bar who is overweight, and he's losing his hair. He smells like beer. Just a rough guy.
This is very similar to the last one, but it's a little quicker. This one feels a little bit more athletic. Like you're jumping from one platform to another platform. This one feels like your finger is wet, and you're trying to move it on glass. It tells me to jump in, to go for it, to be a little ballsy, be ready. It makes me feel energetic. It makes me feel alert.
This one reminds me of a heartbeat. As for the touch, it feels like I'm being shocked with electricity. It's very abrupt but also resting. It kind of reminds me of when you get really scared, and you can feel your heartbeat in your body and your face and your lungs. That's kind of how it feels. It feels like my finger is touching wood like fresh-cut wood, and there are these little patches of abrasion, and you hit these little patches with your finger. I feel like a big event just happened. And the event was adrenaline in a bad way, like you are in a parasympathetic state or aroused in the sense that you're alert.
This makes me want to slow down to really appreciate it. It feels like ice skating. Very smooth and melodic. A graceful person who's sly or charismatic? This reminds me of being outside, specifically near Fredriksberghave, the gardens in Fredriksberg, where there's this ice skating rink. I guess colder winter. It's very good. It feels really natural. It doesn't feel forced. It's very, yes, natural. I feel relaxed. I can let my guard down. What's the word? Vulnerable. Secure.
This one reminds me of a frog ribbiting. Being in an area that is humid and there's water around, maybe smelly. This one also makes me feel curious, like a sense of adventure, wanting to go see what's going on. Discovery. This is telling me to come in. The water is warm. You're invited. Yes, sit down. There's a fireplace right here and maybe a few beers. I would describe this person as being mysterious, but in a sense, that they're uncanny. There are multiple levels of depth. Deep.
This one also reminds me of a heartbeat but more of a slow-down heartbeat, more of a relaxed one. This one feels rough. It feels like I'm touching leather or old skin. It makes me think I'm in a retirement home or an old person's home. There are just people just sitting and doing nothing and being lethargic. They are immobile and sitting still. The only thing I can think of is sitting on the couch, an old couch.
This one is disruptive. I feel like you're painting or something, or you are writing, typing some continuous action. There's an interruption, but you keep going. Highly alert. Almost like caffeine. You've already drunk a cup or two of coffee, and you're hyper-aware. There's a smooth vibration followed by a sort of pulse. I don't know if the smooth vibration comes back immediately after the pulse or if there's a pause. But the smooth vibration is rigid, and the pulse is unexpected.
This one's also very gentle. It kind of reminds me of walking through sand like fine sand, and you can feel it filtering through your feet. Daydreaming. Pensive. Inquisitive. Carefree. It feels very rounded, very soft as well. It reminds me of being alone on a beach by myself that you just whimsically decided to do.
This reminds me of when I got a lot of gas, and I got a fart, and you're really trying to not let it out all at once, but it just comes in little spurts, little sputters. Gassy. Obnoxious. Unwanted. It makes me feel like I should be careful because you never know. It makes me feel kind of paranoid but not really, kind of anxious. I would describe this as an anxious person that is kind of hard to follow since they're attending to something else in their head. They are not present. They're absent-minded.
This one reminds me of being at the zoo and seeing elephants. For some reason, it reminds me of if I were to touch the trunk of an elephant and kind of feel the roughness of their skin. I imagine their skin being almost like touching a fish's skin like a shark or a seal. It's smooth but also a little bit rough. It makes me happy. It makes me feel childish. It makes me feel naive. It makes me feel ecstatic. It tickles, but you want to keep touching it because you feel joy. It is very light, very pleasant. It's telling me to go buy that cotton candy, go touch that dog, do things, be ambitious, go do it. You are a kid, and the world is your oyster. Go have that adventure.
This one's hard to figure out. It doesn't really bring up anything in particular. Aimless. I feel like I'm in a lecture, and I don't understand what he's talking about. I feel small vibrations. They're apparent, but they're weak and very frequent. It reminds me of a train like if I were to hear the chugging of a training. It's starting up. But not a train when it's at full speed. Just like at a train station. It's the sound of the train starting. Machinery.
It's a little confusing, untrustable, or at least something to be wary of. Cautious. It makes me feel like I should be aware of something, that there's something coming in. But I can't predict it. Anticipation. It feels like there's sand underneath my finger. It's inconsistent because the grains of sand could be of different sizes or something like that. You're hitting these random patches of sand.
It just feels like, I guess, concentration. You're focusing on something, but you can't figure it out. You're not there. You just aren't getting it. Someone who is unsure. They are non-committal. It feels like rubber, like glass most of the time. If you're are to rub the bottom of your shoe, it feels like rubber, like a very squeaky rough feeling.
This makes me want to dance. It feels on a dance floor. I don't know. Some kind of high higher intensity music. Yes, you're boogieing. It makes me feel macho, charismatic, what's the other one, influential. It reminds me of going to a club in Copenhagen where I didn't know anybody and I was with some friends, and I was drunk and just didn't care, tore up the dance floor and slapped it. It feels very exciting, like high energy. It feels almost like buttons, a little bit, like the way an old school telephone's buttons would feel like, just something that you can explore touch-wise.
This one's well thought out, like you have a plan. You're going through a maze, and you have the map, and you know where you're going. Or you went for a run, and you know the way back home. Confident. Certain. You're making the right decisions without having to think. It's an unobnoxious feeling. I sense very rhythmic medium pulses, medium vibrations. Steve Irwin. Everything about Steve Irwin. He's got a cowboy hat on. He's got short shorts. He's got cowboy boots. I don't know. But he's an explorer. He's a safarist or a person who would take you on a safari adventure. He's really tanned, and he's probably got an accent.
