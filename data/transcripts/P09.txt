Honestly, nothing. I'm just gliding my finger across the screen. It's just like a normal window. It's kind of squeaky, a little bit. No, it's really just like a windowpane, I guess. Maybe I have really hard fingertips. I don't know.
Okay, I can feel something now, I think. It's very subtle, though. It's not really vigorous. It's quite calming, I guess. Very loose. It's just like indents. Yes, indents in the glass. It's not very alarming. It's just subtle.
This one is less rhythmic, I think. Erratic.
Not anything in particular. Maybe uneasy because my finger isn't that smoothly gliding. So it's unpredictable, maybe. Yes, it's more an alarming thing. I guess if this was to be on some sort of computer, maybe it would be telling me not to do something or that something wasn't available to me. Like this thing that you're trying to do can't be accessed.
This one is more soothing, more relaxing, more tender. It's not as violent or as assertive. Just smooth and soft and almost comforting, maybe, but present. It's going to fall asleep, but it's holding me in a weird way. I have no idea. To be calm, I guess.
This one is a bit rougher, like dragging my hand through sandpaper. Yes, it's like with the other one where if I were to use this on some sort of software, it would be telling me not to do something. Posh. Abrasive. Black and white.
Okay. It's not as obvious. Yes, this is the vibrator one. This is the one that is the vibrator. Yes, because it's subtle, but there is a motor inside of it. And in my head, there is a vibrator. Cool. I don't know what it's telling me. I guess I'm just thinking about vibrators now. I don't know what a vibrator would tell me. Pleasure, I guess. Getting off. Sensual sensuality.
This is like the last one, a bit but not as aggressive. You are sliding your sweaty hand across a windowpane, and because you're sweating, it's getting stuck. And it creates a vibration. Carelessness, freeing, because there isn't that much. I can't really detect that much of a pattern vibrationally. So it's letting me do its own thing. It's letting me do my own thing.
This one is weak as well. Okay, wait. Yes, it's not intentional. I feel like it's really subtle, maybe. If it was a season, it would be winter. I don't know if that makes any sense because it's wispy and delicate and light. It's not telling me to do anything, but it's suggesting. Crisp. It's just tender. Tender. That's a good way to describe it. Tender. And just trivial and novel. It's not urgent. It's just kissing my fingers. It's not nudging it in a certain direction. And the contact it has with the fingers is not that much. It goes away instantly. But it's tiny bits of them. It's not as aggressive.
I don't know. Again, it's not as urgent or aggressive. I feel like I'm touching on the surface of a machine, and you can feel the machinery working within it. You're not touching it directly, but it's more on the surface. If I was to be stroking maybe the outside of a car, and you can feel the engine in it. And you're just touching the surface of it. That's what I could imagine, what it would feel like to feel the outside of a car. So I guess I've done that.
This one is a bit more smooth. You're gliding your fingers across ice. When you press harder than there is some sort of resistance. Maybe being restricted. Being limited because you can't really just slide your fingers across it without any resistance. There is always the harder you push, but it depends on how much pressure you put on it, I guess. Smooth. Gliding. Subtle.
Okay, this one's a bit more peppy. Yes, this is telling me something. This is like my alarm going off in the morning. Peppy. I don't know if that's an adjective. Excitable. I guess erratic, but also energetic, but also worried and anxious because it's all happening. There's a lot of vibrations. Alarmed.
This one is a bit like the last one. It just feels like panic, like a heart palpitation or something. Okay, now I'm getting more into it. I mean, it makes me feel alert and aware. I guess I'm doing a lot of work moving around. I guess, panic a bit. It just feels like spiraling into dread because it's quite subtle. The actual sensation is quite subtle, but the more I glide my fingers across the glass, the more I feel. So it reminds me of just overthinking, maybe.
Okay. This has a beat. This has a tempo. Maybe quite vigilant because it feels like an alarm because it's at a steady tempo. So I guess it's someone I would characterize him as being quite organized maybe but also quite fear-mongering. Alert. Aware. Awake.
Okay. This one is more chirpy. It's like a little bird just chirping away. Again, it's like the alarm, but a more emergency alarm. It reminds me of a fire alarm, like panic, I guess. It's good. I'm not complaining. It's not like it's giving me a panic right now, but I feel like it in itself is trying to tell me something that I should be aware of.
It's not obvious. I guess it's dragging my fingers through tar because it's quite slow. Yes, it's inconsistent. If I was to do this, then it would be like, this is a hard thing for me to do. I don't know. I'm kind of working against the current, if that makes sense. Prickly. Tricky. Yes, I'm just negotiating. Someone who is set in their waves wears black and white, stubborn.
