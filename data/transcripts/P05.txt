Yes, it's this small friction. It feels very fast, but also, it just feels like touching something with friction. I don't really get any signals out of it or feel like it wants me to do something. It's just like a small vibration in my finger. Yes, it makes it a bit more difficult. I don't know if it reminds me of something I felt before. Maybe it's the kind of feeling when I've just peeled an orange. And I get this slight friction on my skin because of the juices of the orange. I can get friction from that. And I feel like it's in that area. I don't feel much different with this. It's just there, but I don't really feel like it changes my mood or anything like that.
This feels like a bit more friction than the last one. It's more like some plastic that has small dots on it or small rivets or something like that. I can feel it. And it's like this steady, constant thing. Emotionally, I don't really have a response to it, but I can feel like it's working against me or trying to make me slow down maybe a little bit but physically. It's more difficult to actually move my finger because there's this resistance. If I should describe it to someone else, I would say, like running a finger on the side of a matchbox, so some nimble small dots are running over my skin. And it feels a bit like physically stopping me in my tracks. I think that's what I get from it.
This feels soft in a way. It doesn't really have that much of a texture. Maybe if I'm really concentrating on it, it feels more like lines more than it feels like dots. It doesn't really bring attention to itself. It's just there. I wouldn't be able to tell if it was just the surface that was like this or if there was something else. It feels more discreet and more hidden in a way. I would say it's soft, runny. I think maybe a bit cool, not cold, but like a bit of coolness or something like that. Yes, I think it reminds me of skiing somehow.
It's more sporadic. It feels like it's stopping me more. It feels like it's telling me to stop. I'm pushing, and something is pushing back. I'm trying to get somewhere, but there is a force exerted in the other direction. And it's more like in waves, like not constant. It's trying to tell me to stop and not just be in the way, but actually trying to tell me something like, don't go this way. I feel some kind of stubbornness. I get to feel more stubborn and more want to push against it. It feels like there's something with a thought behind this, but it wants me to do something.
It feels very draggy. Yes, I'm thinking of dragging. It's holding me back, but this is not pushing me. This is more pulling me. It's more of a pulling emotion. It also feels like trying to run away from someone who is holding you back. Someone is having their arms around your waist or something, and you try to get away from them. I feel like that's the feeling that I get from this. I'm getting pulled towards something. It feels not rough, but I don't feel that much, I think. When I run my finger over this, I can imagine the sound of it squeaking, like when you rub a glass or something with some water on it. That's what I'm trying to play music with, a glass. That's the sound I'm feeling.
I don't know. Ice cream, I think, is the first thing that comes to my mind. I think it's a bit soft. I want to say comforting, but it's not really comforting. It might feel more like a touch. Right now, I feel it a bit more like pointy. It comes more in waves or in small outbursts. Jumpy and a bit pushy. Yes, my finger jumping like it's going, and then it's stopping and going and stopping in a way. I would say I think the adjective is jumpy or barrier or something like that.
Yes, this feels like an electric pulse, like a small electric outlet. It feels a little bit tingly. I don't know. It feels like something I felt before, but I can't really place where it is. It feels electrical. No, I don't think I can associate any actions with this. I don't know. I'm thinking of some therapeutic stuff or maybe a massage or something like that, like sitting in a massage chair or something like that.
Yes, it feels very periodic. It wants to tell me something. It feels like an alert of something like a very small alarm clock. The sensation is also electrical or a bit pointy but very periodic. So it feels like an alarm clock. The sound that I get in my head is an alarm clock going off in the morning telling me to wake up. Yes, I feel like it tells me to be alert or to be aware of something. It's more like danger ahead or something. It feels like it's telling me to stop doing something. I should put my attention towards something important.
Yes, this feels very insisting. It feels like it's telling me to stop, but it feels pushy in a way. It's really trying to tell me something. It also feels very physical, I would say. It feels like an object. It doesn't feel electrical, like some of the others. But it feels more like a surface that I'm used to. It's again that I feel like I need to be aware of something. I think it's more that it feels like it wants me to stop moving my finger more than it wants me to be aware of something. I find this more relating to the thing that I'm doing now. I can imagine driving a car and then having a feeling like this in the whole car telling me to slow down, like slow down or stop what you're doing right now. It's not being alert of anything else.
This feels like quite a lot of friction. It also feels tingly, as if an electrical current is running through me. It feels like a weak electrical fence or something like that. You can feel the tingling. I don't really feel like it's trying to tell me anything. It feels very constant. It feels like it's there all the time. It doesn't really evoke any feelings. It's just there. I don't really think that it reminds me of anything. It should be an electric fence or something like that, but a very small voltage. I don't know. Maybe a bit of excitement. That is not an action. Or doing something that you have to gather up the courage to do, I would say. But it's not a specific action that I could do. But I think I'm just relating it to the electrical fence. I think that's the main action that I'm feeling or associating it with.
The first thing I was thinking was an electrical saw, not a saw machine, but the round ones, a round saw spinning around. And then I get this pulsating. It's almost like a heartbeat or something like that or like a pulse you can feel on someone. I would say it's electrical. And then there are these small shocks. Yes, there are these things that bring attention to themselves. I don't know what they're trying to tell me. It feels like communication, but I don't know what it wants to communicate.
Yes, it feels like the sound of going over a glass, but not making music on it, but more like washing your windows or something like that. It feels like a squeaky noise. And I can feel it's pulsating. But it doesn't really communicate to me, or it doesn't feel like communication. It feels more like a part of the surface or something that's just there when I'm running my fingers over it. I would say it's like when you are cleaning your kitchen, and you run the cloth over a dirty area where it stops in its tracks but then continues going on. Yes, I would say cleaning the kitchen counter.
There's not really anything that comes to my mind, actually. Maybe, I don't know, spitting. I think that's the first coherent thing that came into my mind. I get a picture of yellow or purple or something like that. I don't know. It feels like color. I don't know why. It reminds me of something, but I don't really know what it reminds me of. I have this unclear picture of some plastic looking like jigsaw puzzles with some colors on them. But I don't know what it is. Maybe a feeling of some playset when I was a kid. I think that's what's coming to my mind. I had this playset where you could have these infrared lights, and you could set up this alarm system. Somehow that reminds me of this, like playing with electrical things as a child.
I would say it's periodic. It comes in waves. It feels like it's trying to stop me, but it doesn't feel like it's succeeding. It's saying stop, stop, stop, stop, but not really putting effort into it. So it's half-hearted messaging that it feels like. I don't really think I can put any adjectives to it. It feels like a fence. It's strong. It's emphatic. I'm sure that it's there, and it's insisting, but not in a way that succeeds with it. It's insisting, but also not really trying or not giving it all.
I'm thinking of jets in a jacuzzi or a spa or something like that, like these small water --. Yes, it feels like water pushing out on me of these small water jets used for massaging. That's the feeling I'm getting from this, like calmness and relaxation, I would say. It's feeling relaxed. I would say going to the swimming pool or going to a spa or something, something leisurely, but something relaxing. I'm not exercising, but I'm relaxing in the water. I think that's what I'm really doing. Maybe going into the sauna after that.
This one is really annoying, I think. It's really holding me back. It's in the way. It's biking across cobblestone. I don't know. It's not like it's stopping me, but it's really an inconvenience, like really saying, slow down, take it easy, stop, at least tone down what you're doing. I feel like I want to get away from this sensation. I don't want it to get worse. So I want to slow down at least until I can get away from this. It doesn't feel electrical. It feels very physical, very much like a hard surface, like a real everything. It feels very forceful. It's a lot of force. It's feeling like my finger is skipping over stuff. It's running over stuff. I'm just jumping up and down. It feels like the most friction yet. And it's just making my finger jump up and down.
