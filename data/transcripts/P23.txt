This feels very small textured as if it would be stopping my finger from moving smoothly across the glass, but really really small. Sometimes when you take your finger over your laptop next to the trackpad, it feels similar. Not really vibrations, more as if my finger can't really slide smoothly across the glass as if it would be a little sticky maybe. I can't really feel or say how it makes me feel. It feels not super pleasant. I see that it's glass, but it's moving not as smoothly as glass would normally feel. It feels like the glass is more textured. As I said, it feels like sometimes when you move your finger over your laptop next to your trackpad. It feels similar to that, almost like a brushed metallic, like a brushed metal texture, maybe, a little bit.
This feels even more sticky than before, really much textured, almost soft in a way, maybe, maybe even like velvet, a little bit like a velvet maybe. No, not really. It's like a medium buzzing but not low, not high, and more like a neutral buzzing sound. Yes, it feels like touching something. I can't really describe it.
Now it feels like my fingers are wet. Yes, it totally feels like my fingers are wet on a smooth surface. Maybe that is if I would have too sticky hands or too greasy fingers, maybe, going over a smooth surface. I'm feeling breezy. It's hard to say. It wouldn't feel like nice skin. Maybe after sport, exercise, maybe? Yes.
I can't really tell the difference. It's a lot less than before. Actually, no, it feels smoother now. It feels very smooth. It doesn't help me glide along, but it feels easier to glide along. It's just very, very small resistance. Yes, maybe as if I was some sort of navigational --. I feel some resistance to every direction I push or pull in, as if there was weight behind each movement. Maybe in the context of swiping over a map, I would swipe uphill. I would follow a route. And I'll be going upstairs because it's harder to move forwards. Yes, a plate. Maybe if you get the last food of a plate or something.
Okay. This feels super sticky again. Not really vibrations but less sliding like super super super tiny vibrations. But it feels like my skin is sticking more to the surface, though. Yes, if you take off a protective screen, protective plastic from your screen for the first time. Yes. Soothing. A nice sound, just like ongoing notes being held.
This feels more as there are intervals between vibrations, maybe like swiping through a gallery of images, and each vibration would be a new picture. Ever-changing. It feels like it's going on and off. But not in a bad way. It still feels nice. It doesn't really get sticky. It just still allows you to swipe, but it gives you some feedback every now and again.
This feels similar but more friction but not sticky. It's still easy to slide but has more vibration and more feedback than the one before. Now I really feel it. When I swipe across the screen every few centimeters, I get a little bump. The faster I go, the more bumps I get. This also feels maybe like a gallery of pictures of stuff that gives you feedback as soon as you land on the next point of interest. I can't really characterize this as a person, to be honest. Yes, it feels tactile and nice, like haptic feedback to a screen situation or to an event that happens on a screen.
Okay, this is also like small vibrations, like not a lot of vibrations but each of them is much more pronounced. I really know that I have a bigger texture than I'm feeling. It tells me that I have a rougher texture that I am gliding over. Yes, maybe of a wall texture, maybe, like a very small textured wall. Yes, maybe just touching and feeling a concrete wall, maybe. I can't really put any emotion on this one.
This feels very, very high resistance in each bump. It feels like a sound you hear when you scroll through a library of pictures on an iPhone very fast. That rattling noise that you get if you try to scroll quickly by 500 pictures or 100 pictures at once. This is what this feels like, the sounds. I'm gliding over a lot of content, maybe. This is nice. I like this one. Working quickly, like a quick-thinking person. I'm getting a lot of stuff or looking through a lot of stuff and getting a lot of stuff done, maybe. This was it feels like, like a high frequency of medium-size things that are being done and worked over. It feels like medium-size bumps or not-so-small bumps. I can really feel them. And pretty close to each other. When I go over the surface, I would say, every five millimeters, there's a big bump or a medium-size bump. The last one was really intense.
I don't see any bumps particularly, but it feels like it makes the whole surface, also with all four fingers, a little stickier and not as smooth, more textured and a little bit rougher maybe. My fingers are starting to not slide but just keep on getting stuck a little bit. I feel like I could hold on to this. Here it feels like getting a little bit stuck because you move, but it can't really move forward smoothly. This feels like I actually cling on to a piece of glass and climb up just by holding on to the glass because it feels like it is very, very sticky. Maybe not sticky in this way, but I could grab it really well. If this was an object, I could really hold it in my hands firmly, and it wouldn't slip out of my hand.
This one even more. It feels even more textured. It feels like my fingers are wet again but not slippery, more like some kind of glue on it. It feels like it's very easy to hold on to, like you could spider-walk up a glass front with that. Not so easy. It doesn't make me feel that easy. It feels more like I'm stuck in something. Again, not stuck in something, but I can grab this one especially well. It tells me that this object that I'm touching is made for being held. That you don't lose the grab of it. You can always hold on to it. That's what it's made for. Now I see that the last one was very intense. Now I can feel it.
This one feels like a lot of small bumps again but also bigger ones in between every few centimeters, I feel like. A normal person, like every day you and me. Nothing really special, but still nobody you would overlook on the streets. You'd notice them, but they don't look weird or anything. I mean, I can feel it really good now, but I can't put any action on it that I would associate it with. This one even feels more like it, like the texture you sometimes get on your laptop next to the trackpad. This one slides a bit, and then it catches you up again like a textured metal maybe, like brushed chrome or something.
This is also very tactile. This doesn't want to slide at all. This feels like rubber. This feels like rubber a bit. Yes, but not a soft, smooth rubber, like a rubbery texture. Holding a ball, maybe. Holding a small rubber ball. Like having a good trip or something. It feels good. It feels tactile. Again, this is an object that you can really hold well in your hands. Maybe it feels like a rubber grip for a tennis racket or a hammer or something, like something you really can't let go of or shouldn't let go of. Every time you turn it off, I feel how different it was.
This one feels very mellow. This one also feels like it has bumps in it. An underlying texture then some bumps that go on every couple centimeters. Yes, this could be a scrolling-down like something on social media where you have long posts, and every few centimeters you scroll, there is a new one with a big bump. Telling you that there's a big bump. Nice, it feels good. It feels like you're scrolling through a lot of content, maybe. Someone who's online a lot. I don't know why but this one really feels like it could be scrolling through social media on the phone. So I'd say the person is also very social media involved. Or like a forum or something like a forum where you have different articles that you scroll through.
It's a lot of very, very small vibrations. This feels, maybe, like if you would change the temperature on a thermostat. Now I am doing a circle movement with my finger. Yes, it feels like I would operate some kind of device with that maybe where you have a dial that you crank something up like volume. Yes, like volume louder or quieter with small increments and bumps around the wheel. It feels like a lot of small to medium size bumps. And every now and again, there is a bigger one in there but not really that much bigger. It just feels like you can sense the distance that you go with your finger very well. Maybe something where you would have to really dial in on a specific value on a wheel or touchscreen wheel. Because you can feel every millimeter that you're moving forward, you can feel really well. That's a nice feeling. It feels good because you can feel where you're actually moving and how far are you are moving.
This feels like if you are walking past a fence and have a stick that you just rattle along the fence because there are bumps every now and again but nothing in between. The faster you go, the faster rattling goes, or the bumps become. This could be something for a wheel or a setting where you can scroll through a lot of values until you land where you need to be. Maybe if you go to a website and you have to select your country of origin. Or you have lots of lots of countries that you scroll through. This feels like the sound it does when you scroll through. Yes, a little bit of hecticness because you can scroll so fast and still feel where you are as if you were in a hurry a bit to find your selection.
