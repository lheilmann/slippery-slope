I feel very small spikes, like if I were touching a lot of very small needles together. It is maybe like a small rhythm with a small pace. It's almost calm, like peaceful, like a peaceful experience, I would say. Yes, I would say calm and peacefulness definitely. It's almost like if I were playing a video game and I were in a very repetitive part of the game like that type of peacefulness that comes from repetition. This would definitely be someone that is doing something constantly like jumping like making an action but the same action constantly like jumping or running but not like running fast or running like almost jumping. Yes, someone in a very consecutive action.
This one, I would say, is faster. It feels faster. This one that is faster reminds me of almost the sensation of riding a bicycle when you are not on a road that is flat but one that is rougher. It is more or less similar to that sensation. As a sound, I would say that this is almost like a description of maybe someone shaking or something like that. Yes, it's like when you're watching a cartoon, and then someone accidentally is shaking, and then it has a sound. It's more or less like that sound.
This one, I don't know why, but it reminds me a lot of the sea. It reminds me a lot of almost like touching the waves when a wave is coming to you and then going back to the sea. It makes me feel like I'm touching something that is moving if I were touching a wave that is coming in and then a wave that is coming back. In the feeling, I feel, again, a pattern, but this time the pattern is first a little faster and then a little slower and then a little faster and then a little slower. I would say maybe tougher.
This one makes me feel as if I were in a hurry for something. I just feel something tickling. I feel that it's a sensation of something touching the tip of my finger, but this time the pattern is almost like a piano song, like the piano part of a song that is a little bit faster. This one is almost like something is coming. It's that part of a song where you have this piano, and then the piano is telling you the next big part of the song is just about to arrive. It's almost like announcing something that is going to happen. Yes, it makes me feel excited when I know that something is just going to happen, and then I am definitely excited because something is going to happen. Just the moment before knowing that you are going to be surprised and amazed. Yes, definitely.
I feel a little bit like a [onomatopoeia] in the finger like [onomatopoeia]. Again, this reminds me a lot of the sound that they play in all movies when there is like a cartoon walking like [onomatopoeia] like one step at a time. Yes, walking, it is definitely like a cartoon walking. This one almost makes me feel happy, like when you see a cartoon walking, and you're like, fun, a cartoon walking. Something nice, relaxed. I would not say that this is a person. I would definitely say that this is, to me, more like a cartoon. I definitely picture the cartoon from Beauty and the Beast, the one that is a clock, the one that is fat that has a clock in the belly. It's like walking because it is not too fast, then it is definitely not a fast character. It definitely needs to take some time between the steps. That is why I feel it is almost funny.
This one goes too slow. It reminds me a lot of a heart beating but like a heart that is beating super slow, like worrying slow. It is so slow. I feel it very, very few times, but when I feel it, it is almost scary. But it is so slow. It is not even a warning is like something that to feel worried about, I would say. It's again the feeling that there's something rough like a pulse that is getting rougher and rougher. And that sensation reminds me of a lot of doctors that are looking at one of those screens that are showing the beats of the heart, and it's going super slow. A little bit more aroused, like stressed and alert. Yes, it definitely makes me feel more alert and almost a little bit cringy. It is so intense but also with so much spacing between the stimuli. It is not a happy emotion.
I would say that this one is almost like a drumbeat. It's like if you put your hand in a drum and someone is like kicking at the drums, and then you have your hand there. That is the thing that I'm feeling in the tip of my finger. This one, I would say, is more almost like a musical thing. These ones that go a little bit faster, all of them, make me feel more musical. This one specifically is almost like the beat of a drum, like if it was like a drummer having some rhythm. If this rhythm was a person, I would say it is definitely like the drummer of the band, the drum player of the band, and just like staying there in the background being chill, playing the same rhythm.

This reminds me of a ball bouncing, but it's a big ball. It's like if you were jumping, but each jump takes you a lot of time, just like if you pass a lot of time like almost doing a squat and then jumping back again to the top because the pulses are --. I would say that it's intense, but then it doesn't go that fast. If this was a wave, I would describe it as a wave with normal frequency but a bigger amplitude. I definitely feel the sensation for a longer time, but it's also not super frequent. It reminds me of a big object trying to jump. I can feel like a big bump, and then it disappears but quite fast, and then the glass becomes rough, and then I feel it again. It's like a pulse, but the pulse is slower. I would say that this pulse makes me feel almost a little bit boring, like it is less interesting than the other ones. Yes, it's less interesting than the ones that go faster or the ones that are more intense.
I feel this one is so small. I feel this one with fewer intensity. It makes me feel like if I were almost observing something. It is so small that it reminds me of really maybe not focusing but of observing something that is tiny and small. I would describe this maybe as the flying of a mosquito or a little insect. It is like coming next to you, and then it stays there, and then it continues flying. But it's the sound of something that is so small. Yes, it reminds me of something that is small.
I feel that I am in a car right now, passing to a bumpy road. Yes, if I were in a car, I would feel this with all my body, but right now, I'm only feeling it with the tip of my finger. It is that. I am in a car, and the road is super bumpy, and everything is shaking a lot. The adjective is bumpy, like a road that is quite bumpy. It makes me feel happy, like part of the adventure. If I am in a car and I know that I'm on a bumpy road because you are doing something definitely out of the city. The thing is that the only bumpy roads that I know are in places that are sunny, so it also reminds me of a sunny place. Yes, in my skin, it is like if I have my hands on a wheel, and it's like the wheel of a car that is like going on a bumpy road. That is what I feel in my skin. Yes, it's telling me that we are not on a very fancy road at this moment. It's telling me this is not a fancy moment.
This again reminds me of something small but something small that is going faster. So if I were to describe a vivid image, it would be something like a clown driving a motorcycle while doing juggling, but it's like a very small clown on a motorcycle. I would say it is again a repetitive pattern, but this one is faster, and the sensation is like if it was something super small touching the tip of my finger, but that is going fast. To me, the emotion is like when you are in a circus, and you're observing something that is fun, but it's like if you are looking at it from very far. Something that is intriguing, but you are looking at that from far. It is telling me that there is something interesting happening, but I need to get closer to see what exactly is happening.
This one reminds me of like if someone was falling because it's like small, small, and then one large. That reminds me a lot of if you see someone that is almost about to fall down of the bicycle, and then they fall down of the bicycle. I would say that this one to me is almost telling me like there's something happening right now, and then that thing happens. In my finger, I feel two ticks like ticks from the clock like [onomatopoeia] and then one large beat. Yes, it makes me feel that if this were an entire scene of a movie or a video game, it would be like the sound that is telling me like there's something about to happen, but it's also showing the event that is happening. It is almost like the last part of the joke. You already said the premise, and then you say the last part of the joke. Or the last part of the magic trick when you show everyone the base of the magic trick, then you build the prestige, and then this is the last kick of the magic trick.
Maybe this is going to sound weird, but this reminds me of the beginning of a salsa song. In the beginning, it's like, you have a rhythm in the beginning and then one last part that is like [onomatopoeia]. It reminds me of the beginning of --. Well, it's not the beginning of a salsa song, but it's like one of those parts in any salsa song when you have some musical instruments that play one last part, and then you have silence, and then all the orchestra comes with the last hit in that part of the song. It makes me feel a little bit amazed. Yes, amazed. That sound, that empty step in the middle, is almost left in the room empty, and then there's something big coming in. It's a pattern that is definitely a periodic pattern, but it has more parts now. In the beginning, it's like two patterns super fast, then two patterns super fast again, then a silent, and then two beats that are longer and consecutive.
This one is too long. It's too long. It's the same sensation for a lot of time. Yes, it reminds me of someone farting and then farting forever or working forever or a car making a sound that is not necessarily something where you would feel pleasure, and it goes forever. It is someone that is nasty. Someone is burping for a lot of time or farting for a lot of time or a truck driver but a nasty truck driver honking the klaxon for a lot of time. On my finger, I feel, I would say, that almost noise, and it's the same thing over and over again. It's just like a very long, long sound but in my finger.
This one is definitely telling me that something or someone was in a hurry. If I were watching a movie, this would be like the sound that was telling me like this entity is in a hurry. I would say that I feel a pattern in my finger. Again, it's fast, but it's also not that intense. Yes, it's fast. It's not that intense, but it is fast, so it makes me feel like if I were looking at someone that is in a hurry. I would say that it's like a clock that is going too fast, but it's not like a disturbing clock. It's just like a clock in the background that is definitely going fast. That's why I feel that I am in a hurry, but it's not a very disturbing clock. But again, since it is not that intense, it doesn't feel like it's talking to me, but if I were observing what is happening.
