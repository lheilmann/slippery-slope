It definitely feels like there are some breaks on my finger, almost. It's heavy. It's like when you use your finger on the touchpad or something, but everything is more heavy to move past. Something's weighing you down. Maybe it feels like a mirror right when you've cleaned it, and there's more friction to it. I'm going on about the mirror. It reminds me of working and cleaning at my old gym, where I cleaned those mirrors.
It feels even more heavy than the one before. It really feels like it's less smooth. Usually, there's some type of coating that makes it very smooth when you use touch displays. This is the opposite of that. It's very sturdy almost. It feels like something's trying to hold me back. A day where you're so tired that everything just feels more heavy and takes more focus.
This one is hard. I can sense the friction, as I've talked about before but also sometimes I can feel like small vibrating sensations. It's tough to differentiate from the other one. It feels a lot like the one before.
It's like touching something that's whole new, unused almost. When you have something of glass, and you pull the first plastic film layer off, and it's still a bit sticky. That's almost what it feels like.
This one is hard to differentiate again. It feels a bit like the last one, where it's almost like the glass is the opposite of being greasy. There's still a lot of friction. It's a bit heavy to move your finger around compared to what you usually sense with a touch display. It's a bit like moving your finger down a window, but your finger is a bit wet, creating this weird kind of friction. Compared to when your fingers dry, it's more smooth more easy to move across, but when it's wet, it sticks a bit, and it breaks more.
This feels more bumpy, definitely. It's unsmooth, like it's not what you expect when you move your finger across the glass. It doesn't feel flat at all. It would be somebody that you could discuss a lot with that you may or might not always agree with. Like you can have a lot of differences of opinion but not in a harsh way. It's a bit funny. It makes me feel like longing after doing things on surfaces that remind me of this wavy kind of thing like going swimming or going skiing or going cross biking or mountain biking.
It feels kind of distant. It makes you feel a bit sad almost. There's longer between the ups and downs. It reminds me of missing someone or being away. When I move my finger down, it goes up and down these small slopes. Or like pulses.
This one is easier. It's not as heavy. It feels almost light. Compared to the earlier one, where it felt like I had a wet finger running across the glass, now it feels like I'm dry again. Almost like a positive feeling like a burden has been lifting lifted from your shoulders. Or like the sky has cleared out. It's not as heavy as a day.
This one is tough. I'm not sure I can sense it as well, so it's a bit frustrating. It makes you feel frustrated.
It feels like the glass is evened out a bit. It feels more flat, like the surface is even. The friction is not as hard to get through. It's not as heavy. It doesn't feel as heavy. Yes, no more bumps. It reminds me of having one of those days where everything just goes smoothly, like almost such a productive day. Usually, I have this feeling on Mondays as I've had like a well-rested weekend, and you just blast through today, and by the evening, you're just like, you went through all this stuff, and it didn't even feel that hard. It just went smoothly by.
This one feels a bit prickly, almost. It feels like I'm more on the surface, whereas some of the earlier sensations felt like I was almost going down into the glass. This feels like I'm moving on the outer surface.
The movement feels like I have to force it almost. It's more obstructive, the friction. I get these small sensations of bumps again almost as I move across. This feels like somebody, almost like trying to hold you back. Like wouldn't want the best for you, but drains you, drains your energy, drains your emotions. Not the type of person that you need in your life.
It feels smooth again. The surface is even now, and it doesn't feel like it's breaking or slowing me down as much. It's like without obstacles, easier to move through. Again, it's like I'm on the surface of the glass. I'm on the outer.
It makes me feel fresh like I just woke up in the morning. It's hard to describe. It's like all the thoughts and processes in your brain haven't really come during the day, so you're empty-minded almost.
This one is very hard to differentiate from the glass, almost like it's hiding from me, and I can't find it.
It's very subtle. The surface feels a bit uneven again. It's almost like the friction caused my finger to vibrate across the glass when I move it. It's like someone you feel good around, like the emotions are very complimentary to your own. Yes, like kind of on the same emotion field. You're vibing.
