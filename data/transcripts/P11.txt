I can't feel that much, but initially, when it changed, I think it felt a bit tingly. It's a bit of a tingling sensation that I can feel a little bit on my finger that's not on it as well. It feels a little bit tingly, which is a bit odd and almost like there's something in between my finger and the glass. I don't know, actually. Grainy. I don't think you could describe a person as grainy. Not very different from my normal self. It hasn't really had much of an impact. I don't know.
It's really slippery. It feels a lot more slippery. It feels like it's wet. It feels like there's some sort of liquid on the surface. Yes, it's a little bit icy, a little bit odd, because it's like the feeling of it being wet, but then also not cold. It just feels a bit like something's a bit wrong. It does really feel like I have a window that's just been cleaned or something because it's like the feeling of glass, but a bit slippery. You spilled something on a surface. I think I would go with slippery because that's the first thing that came to mind, and that's why it feels like it's easier to move. It feels like my finger is going faster.
It's a little bit odd. It's as if there's something on the surface, but I can't feel it. And almost like when you run your hands on a really thin piece of carpet, a carpet that's got lots of stuff in it, not a big, fluffy one, but a boring carpet they put in hospitals and stuff. That's a really hard question. It feels bumpy. It feels like there's something in between. Because it's got this carpet sensation. It feels like it's going to be a bit more static. It's going to be harder to run your fingers across, but it's not. It just feels like there's something in between the glass.
That I can't really feel much. This is a lot harder to work out the feeling than the other ones. And I also don't know whether it's just because I've now run my fingers over the same spot. It feels a bit weird. It feels a lot harder, whereas the other one was really slippery. This feels harder for it to run my hand across. I don't know. It doesn't really feel like much. I'm not getting as much of a sensation of this one.
I don't know. I also can't feel as much of this one. I can't work out whether it's just doing the same pattern that's making it harder to run your hand from side to side or whether it's actually what it is supposed to be doing. It feels like there's a lot more vibrations and stuff coming from this one. It's a little bit like my phone is in my pocket, and it's vibrating a little bit.
This is a bit like perspex glass. It's a little bit plasticky. I don't know if that makes sense. It's almost a bit dryer. It's not very pleasant. I don't particularly like the feeling. It's like when you're unpacking boxes or something. It's got that same sort of sensation. Yes, I'm not that great. It's like if I wouldn't want to voluntarily touch it. I think it would rather just be something that you would run your hands over and go. Take your hands off, or at least I would.
It doesn't really feel like much. It just feels like I'm touching a computer screen or something. It's not just the pure glass. It feels a little bit more tactile but not as bad as the perspex-like feeling of the last one when you're running over. Yes, it does remind me of just feeling a phone or something. It's got the same sort of sensation, or at least like a touch screen laptop.
This feels a lot lighter for some reason, almost soft in a really weird way. It's not slippery, like the last one, a bit more soft as in a pillow. I feel like it feels like more of material as in something cloth-like than glass, and that is easy. It's more of a gentle sensation. It's quite kind, soft-spoken. There's a lot less friction, or it feels like it than the other ones. And it's quite calming. It feels more like you're painting or something than doing an action.
I don't like the feeling of this at all. It feels like your fingers are getting stuck in something like a strange vibration sensation as they get stuck. So it feels like I shouldn't be doing it. As if it was a screen, it would be --. Yes, I guess the sensation is sticky. It's just not particularly pleasant. I don't like the feeling. As you bring your hands across it, it feels like there's little vibrations going into your fingers way more than the other ones. I don't like that. It's a bit uncomfortable. Also, it's slightly reminding me in the pattern that it feels on my fingers of the iPhone alarm. It's got a sequence to it, and you can sort of feel that in your fingers.
Okay. This is even worse. That's just like the last one, but just better. It feels like my phone's vibrating, but I've just got my hand on it. I've got a phone call coming through, and it's got one of those annoying ringtones where it's ringing constantly. And there's a vibration setting on. Yes, I mean, all I can think of is a phone because it feels like a vibration. I find that question really hard when you try to feel it. I don't know. Adjectives don't spring to mind. It feels a lot more urgent than the last ones. It feels like I'm supposed to be doing something, and I'm ignoring it.
This doesn't feel like much, not really. It doesn't feel like much difference to when it's just the glass. Not really, because I can't really feel much with this one. It's a lot more pleasant than the last. The last ones felt like they were vibrating a lot.
It's got an odd sensation. It doesn't feel completely smooth anymore, but a little bit more like your fingers getting stuck. But it's not consistent. It feels a bit like if you've got rubber boots on like rubber Wellies. And you go into someone's house, and you brush your feet, and because there's something about the two materials together, it feels like it's getting stuck. I mean, it's not unpleasant. It just feels like there's something in the way that this makes them stick. My hands are a bit sweatier than they were a few seconds ago, but it doesn't feel like that on my actual hand, just on the glass. As it gets stuck, that's an area that should be paid more attention to. There's a reason why it's getting stuck or at least feels like that like caught rather than stuck, I guess.
It feels like there's a pattern to this one, as well as like a vibration but not that it's getting stuck and not like it's ringing either. Not bad because it's quite a familiar feeling rather than a phone ringing. It feels more like there's music playing from the phone, and you can just feel something, but it doesn't feel as intentional. A little bit like a base from a speaker. Consistent.
It feels it feels different on each finger. No, I can't associate it with anything that I've felt before. As you're running your finger across it, you hit a point where you can feel it. And it's like vibrations afterward, and then it fades a bit, and then you can feel again. It's almost like you hit the peak of the sensation, and then it fades a little bit. It feels like there's a texture to it. Almost like you're feeling brail. And that it's bumpy. That's maybe a good way of explaining it. It feels like you're running over individual bumps. It got that much texture to it.
This one doesn't feel like much. Almost a little bit tingling in my fingers, but other than that, it just feels like glass. I once had a glass screen protector that gave a similar sensation, but I think it just wasn't put on properly. It's quite a nice sensation. It doesn't feel sticky or uncomfortable. You've just touched something that is a little bit static, but you've not had a static shock. It just feels a bit like static.
I can't really feel much. No, not really. Just a little bit rough. It's almost like a piece of wood that's just being sanded, so it should be smooth, but it's a little bit not, a little bit more textured than just a smooth piece of wood. It does feel like it doesn't normally feel like this. It feels like this for a reason. It's hardy, a bit rough around the edges. It does remind me of the feeling of sandpaper. It reminds me of my granddad building stuff. It's got the same sort of sensation as a piece of wood or a drawer or something like that.
