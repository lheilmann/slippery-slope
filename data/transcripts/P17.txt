It's a very subtle sensation. It's like someone is shaking or shivering, like little impulses which are fractured, but they're really subtle. It's, I don't know, like a small bird which is shivering which I am stroking, or something and the heart is beating fast or something.
It feels like when my cell phone is muted or without sound and I get a call or something, and it's like laying on a desk, and the vibration sound of the [onomatopoeia] tells me that someone is calling me. Actually, like I said, imagine your phone is ringing, and it's on vibration. A little needy, like calling for attention all the time, like hey, I need some help, hey, did you know that about me, hello. I can tell that there's a fade-out in the sensation. It's tingly on my fingertip. They're different strengths of vibrations as well. 
That reminds me of a high-pressure sand machine which I hear from afar. It's not really rough and strong and close. It's like I'm on a construction place, and I hear this high-pressure sand machine. It's a little fractured, the sensation, but as sand and stone would come out of the machine, something like this. It's actually quite calm and similar to the white noise I'm listening to. It's like the 3D to my sound on my earphones right now. Chill out. It's okay.
I can sense on my skin that there are breaks in between the sensation. The sensation is tingly again on my fingertips. Yes, it's gentle, but I can totally feel it. Maybe actually anger, which comes in waves like [onomatopoeia]. I don't know, like a pondered mindset. Actually not. That's why I'm struggling with the sensation.
That reminds me of holding my electric toothbrush in my hand while it's giving this information to change sites or something like this irritation and frequent or same vibration. It's hectic but repetitive, like calculative to my fingers. It would be quite nerve-wracking if I would hear the sound I would want to leave the room, I think. It's not too high-pitched, but I think in the higher levels. I don't know. It's not a calm sound.
This is a very subtle sensation. I can barely feel it. They're little electric shocks but really gentle. It's like hiking and having an electric fence and trying out if there's electricity on it. It's really subtle, but it gives you little shocks. It's very shy, not asking much from others but still alive. It makes me feel that little things count as well. Big sensations are crazy and easy to feel, but this is like I can feel stuff like this on my finger. That's good to know. I can sense that it feels like those electric shocks, as I explained them go a little further than my skin. It goes to my first joint in my finger, so it's a deeper but really gentle feeling on my finger.
That's a rough sensation. That's quite hectic and gives me a warning or something. It's like a signal. If my cell phone did this sensation, I would freak out. I guess because I did something wrong, like a warning. I feel like a rough sensation, no experience on my finger. It's shaking. It's like a strobe light in the club, which actually doesn't give me the feeling of freaking out. It's more like a rhythmic light show.
That's again quite hectic like an alarm went off or something, like hey, wake up. Yes, it's like telling me to react or to wake up or to decide, like a countdown for a decision or something. I would describe it as a pattern which is super rhythmic and repetitive, like an alarm that went off. Yes, I hate alarms because I love to sleep. It's like an impulsive and again tingly sensation. It's funny because this sensation gives me a feeling I can feel my nails. It's like filling my volume in my fingertips or something. It's weird.
That's a subtle pattern as well. There's some rhythm as well. It's really subtle, the rhythm, as well. It's more like I would stroke a weird underground. It's like a weird structure. It's like when your neighbor two floors beneath you puts a screw in the wall.
It's like I would stroke a material which has a profile of little lines. It makes me feel like I pay attention to someone who's talking, and meanwhile, I'm stroking this surface.
That's like being on a ship which is going down, and there's this evacuation sound and red lights turning on and off. Everyone is freaking out and trying to rescue themselves. Anxious because it's quite clearly a warning. It's a rhythmic pattern which fades out. It's actually like a red light which does circles, and you see the light, and then it turns off, and you see the light, and then it turns off.
You can feel very subtle impulses. They're really fast and then three slower impulses. It's not a big difference to the glass plate without any patterns. It's like when I'm afraid to tell something. That's what I feel in my body, like little shakes before I tell the truth or I don't know. I think what I said.
I feel very little. It could be also an illusion as if the board would be turned off. It's like touching the paper. It's like a structural feeling. I ask myself if something's wrong with my finger. Did it stop to feel anything?
It's like a gallop of some horses [onomatopoeia]. It's like a person who knows their wishes and aims and goes after them no matter what, in a gallop. It's a fast sensation. It's always a triplet. I think in between, there's a little break why it feels like a triplet.
You can actually see the vibration on my finger. It's like holding a jackhammer in my hands, powerful. It shows me that my fingers are a little ticklish. It's like holding a jackhammer in my hands.
That's an interesting feeling, actually, because it's super fractured. Some impulses are a little bit stronger than others. It's like being out of breath after running a lot, and my heart is beating fast, so exhausted.
