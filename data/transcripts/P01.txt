No, but I think that is largely because it's quite weak, rather than the pattern itself. No, not yet. It's quite calming, really. Honestly, because of the white noise, it kind of sounds like a beach, and that's the only thing I can have in my head. I don't really know. It's maybe pulsating. I don't know. Again, it's not massively put me up or down, to be honest. I think if it was a stronger pulse, then maybe. No, but again, I think that's partially more to do with the actual fact that I am here with a friend with white noise. It's not a very distressing situation. Quite pleasant, really. I don't know.
I'm not sure I am feeling this one. It doesn't feel like there's as much of a pulse as the last one, maybe. I don't know. I don't know if it's maybe because this one feels maybe more active or something, and I'm not feeling as much in the pulsing, but maybe more just of a general tingling or something. I don't know. I'm not feeling it super strong, so it's hard to say. It's almost like you're petting a cat or something, but a cat with not very long hair. And it was robotic. It's pleasant. I don't know. This one feels a bit more familiar, I would say.
See, this one feels a bit stronger. Yes, excited. And yes, I suppose I do feel satisfied. Yes, I mean, the actual sensation of itself is quite nice. And again, it's not super strong. It's really quite pleasing. And it's like when you used to have TVs way back in the day. They would have static on them when you touch the screen. It feels like that, but maybe 10 percent of that. So it feels definitely not natural. It's a technological feeling. I don't know. It's an alien feeling. And so things I felt before is a little bit like the TV thing. I don't know. It kind of feels like you might be away to get a massage or something, and they start you off with this.
I'm not really feeling very much from this one, but it's nearly there. I feel like if I get myself into the rhythm, I'll be able to. Not really, because I don't feel enough to actually say one way or another.
This one feels quite regular. It's not super, super strong, but you can kind of definitely feel more of a pulse. This reminds me more of the first one. I don't know if that's actually a helpful answer if they're going to be sequenced, whatever. All I can think of is adjectives now, but it's quite direct, and it's quite regular. And I don't feel distressed other than the fact that I can't think of any nouns. This feels more like you have a fancy alarm clock that wakes you up by giving you very gentle vibrations. That's what this feels like to me.
This one's very urgent. I can really feel this. The others you're having to think about more. It's not sharp. The best word I can come up with is urgent. This feels like really an alarm. It's like no longer being gently woken up. It's like it's 8:15. Get out of bed, like a fire alarm or something important. And it doesn't feel dissatisfying. I mean, it's like, as I said, I feel like an alarm. This feels like you're actions afoot, whereas some of the other ones have been more like soothing or nice on the finger. But this has also been my favorite of them. No, I don't feel bored. The others have felt more familiar. This feels different. I don't know if it reminds me of something that I have felt before. No, not as much like. The other ones have felt more like this is this sensation. It's somewhere back in my deep brain, whereas this one reminds me of things I've experienced before. I just mentioned alarms or things like that. But it doesn't so much remind me of a tactile sensation.
This one is a lot slower. This one feels almost like a heartbeat or something. Yes, it's a heart beating or maybe not a heart. Maybe if you had some sort of system where it was like --. This is so bizarre. It's like a watering system where you have sprinklers that go in regular patterns and put water on people's gardens. It feels a bit like that or something. Yes, it's regular and quite soft. The last one was a bit harsh. It's not soft because it doesn't feel fluffy or anything. It's soft in terms of I can feel the pulse, and it feels more, maybe, indirect. It's like someone else's alarm is going off.
This one feels like regular. What's the right word? It's not as intense as some of the other ones because it is slower. So the other ones are a bit more pressing or urgent. This one feels more like it's still quite harsh and quite strong, but it's not as fast. I know I keep going on about alarms. This one feels like an alarm, or something bad is happening, but they want to keep everyone calm. I mean, it feels like a phone ringing, actually. That's what it feels like. It feels not unpleasant. It's quite a nice intensity. Some of the other ones were a bit more like you're struggling to feel it, or else it was very in your face. This one's more pulsating, which is quite pleasant, but the rhythm of it is not nice or not, not nice, but it's quite jarring. But the actual sensation, the tactile sensation, is quite nice.
I'm not feeling a whole lot on this one. I don't know if that's because I'm not in the zone. Though, I can feel that it's quite rhythmic. It's not very sharp. It's more soft and more constant and not flowing. Dominance to me is like an oppression thing, and it doesn't feel particularly oppressive. But it also doesn't feel submissive. It's maybe a slightly unnerving thing, really. I don't know. No, it feels quite novel. The only thing it feels a little bit like is when your downstairs neighbor has their washing machine on, and the vibrations are coming up to the floor. But you can't necessarily hear or feel the actual rhythm of it. It's more just the constancy or something. I don't know. Indirect, almost.

I'm not feeling a whole lot from this one, to be honest. There's one of the other ones that I said that for. It feels similar. It's like there's something, but I am just not quite getting it.
This one feels like a train or a horse. Excitement is not necessarily the first word I'd be like --. I feel excited, but it's not relaxing particularly. It feels like you're jogging or something. Yes, it's quite rhythmic, I would say. It's quite pulsating, quite up-beat or urgent or whatever. But it doesn't feel alarming to me anyway.
So the last one felt like a horse. This feels like a train, I think. Yes, it's quite nice. It's quite settling and almost soothing or something. Yes, it's like you're on a train or something. So it's not passive or the waves rolling in, and there is a rhythm to it. The last one was quite direct. This one feels less involved or something. I don't know. Yes, I feel satisfied. This one definitely feels positive, like if you were playing a game or something and you had a remote controller. I'm not a gamer. Do they not do, when stressful bits are happening, the remote shakes a lot? This feels like you're doing well in your game, that good things are --. Or you're not in any danger.
This one feels quite strong. This one honestly feels like shaving a little bit, like you're using an electric razor. Just the actual vibrations on my hand feel a little bit like that. This is quite constant. There is a pulse, but there are no gaps, if that makes sense. It's more steady. The fact that it is quite fast does make you feel urgent. I feel like I'm moving my finger faster. It almost feels a little bit like you're at a club, but the techno is very hard and fast. And it's just like not noise, but it's not necessarily rhythmic. I don't know. Yes, but that's just because of the pace. The actual sensation is quite pleasing and nice and soft, a little bit like shaving. With the techno thing, what I meant by that was the tempo of the pulse a little bit more. The pulse that I am feeling anyway is quite fast, almost like a heavy bass line. But it's not like when you're listening to hard techno like [onomatopoeia]. It's not like rhythmic or like constant, whereas this feels rhythmic and constant, but it's just also fast. I don't know. It's not relaxing and maybe slightly stressful, but it feels nice though. It's maybe a little bit like you're coming towards the end of giving a presentation, and it's going well so far. You're like, we're nearly out of the woods, but you're still in quite a high-pressure situation. It doesn't feel not nice, but it also is not relaxing.
This one feels like you have your hand on the printer, one of those big printers we have at work. And it also has the big scanner, and the copier and all that. It's shooting out pages like it's nobody's business. I don't know. You're printing a 200-page thing. And it's really in its rhythm. It is just shooting them out. I don't know. The description I just gave sounds like a boring task, but it's quite pleasing to me. I don't know. Yes, I feel satisfied. It's like mundane or more menial tasks like me doing laundry, for example. I feel like it fills me with --. It's not boredom. It's, I guess, satisfaction, but it's not an excitement either. It's quite rhythmic. It's quite fast. But the last one that I described as shaving that was fast in a way felt like you needed to keep up. This feels like fast the way that you're in a taxi or something. It's not you driving. This is happening, and you're a passenger in that sensation. I don't know. I'm watching these pages shoot out. I don't need to catch them. They're falling into the tray.
I am not feeling a whole lot from this one if anything. Maybe if I slow it down. Yes, this one's nice and slow. I don't feel this one as strong as I feel a lot of the other ones. I don't know. A little bit more bored than the other ones. I think that's the tempo of it, maybe. And the fact that it is not an aggressive pulse to me. No, I don't feel distressed, really. Maybe bored is a good word. It's not bored in the sense that it's unpleasant, but it's just a bit more --. I don't know. I know I have been talking about printers, but maybe a personal printer from the early 2000s. It would take four minutes to print a sheet. I mean you have to be there for really quite a long time, and it is a little boring. I don't know. Nothing more direct. It doesn't feel like you're seeing an alarm or hearing an alarm or like whatever. It's more just like background noise or a background sensation. I don't know. I think it's funny. I'm equating all of these noises. But I think that's how it feels.
