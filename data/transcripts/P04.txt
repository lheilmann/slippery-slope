Okay. It feels a little static, like when you rub a balloon on your head, and then you put it against the --. Yes, exactly when you rub a balloon on your head, and you put it on the wall. That exact kind of static is what I feel. Yes, it's prickly, but not in a sharp way. I feel a lot of small like [onomatopoeia] as if there was a bunch of bamboo woods sticking out, little ones. I was just putting my finger around it. Yes, like tiny little things that I slightly catch on, but not really on my finger slightly catches on to.
Okay. It's like a surface that isn't completely smooth, like a wall that's been painted over. It's not quite sandpaper, but you can tell that there is something between you and the smooth surface. Yes, it's how I imagine that wall would feel. Yes, it's some kind of wall or painted furniture, maybe even a chalkboard, something like that. I don't know if the sensation gives me emotions. I don't particularly like it just because it makes me feel like if I scratch at it, it will make a sound. Or I might get something on my nails. But doing this doesn't make me feel any emotions.
Okay. So you know how last time I said it was like a chalkboard. This is like a whiteboard that I'm trying to erase or like a window that I'm trying to clean. It makes me feel a little bit frustrated because I feel like it should be smoother in some parts than others. I feel like my fingers are just being caught on some dirt or something when it should be really smooth. It's smooth, but your finger feels like it's being tugged by something small. I don't know. Maybe it's some kind of oil or grease or dirt. Yes, it really just feels like something's dragging on it, like some sort of tiny little thing, like a speck of dirt.
I was wondering if this is the one that somebody said sort of feels like farts. I don't know. It doesn't really feel like a fart, but I can feel like something's going on like [onomatopoeia]. It's similar to the last one. But it's a bit more resistance. And I can feel actual specks of dirt. I feel like this glass is dirty. It sort of feels like cleaning a whiteboard, cleaning a window, or at least, what it should feel like when I should have to clean it or something. Gross. I don't know. It's not really gross, but it feels dirty. Sticky. I feel like there are specific parts. Right here, it feels a little bit dirtier than other parts. Maybe that's just me going crazy.
Yes, it feels like little vibrations, but I don't know how to describe it. It's like [onomatopoeia]. It feels like tiny little bristles like very, very small ones that I'm running my finger down, maybe sort of like a toothbrush. It still feels a little bit dirty in some places. I'm wondering if that's just me. It's like a lot of bumps that are soft. They're kind of hard. But they're very, very thin and it's a lot of them. It feels like you're lightly touching a toothbrush like the bristles. I don't know. I don't mind it. It feels fun to touch.
I can feel vibrating. I don't know. It feels like maybe a wooden surface like that amount of friction. It feels like if I have a good speed, I can easily run it around. But when I go a little bit slower, it's harder. I feel a bit more friction, like the feeling of me passing through it. I'd say it's not as smooth as glass, but relatively smooth. Yes, it feels like a surface, like if I were on a table or something. It feels like my dinner table.
Okay. The other one was very uniform. This doesn't feel so uniform. It feels like there are some parts where I'm feeling something and where my finger gets caught. It feels dirty again. It feels like glass. It feels like last time, my fingers getting sort of stuck at some point. If I am rubbing, my finger goes flying through. But then, at some point, it feels like I'm getting stuck on something. I don't like it. I don't know. I feel yucky. I feel like I should go wash my hands.
All right. This one's smooth. I feel some friction. Still, I'm trying to think. It's quite small. I can't tell if it feels like a different surface or if it feels like there's some stuff on it. Maybe it just feels a little dusty. Yes, but I'm trying to figure out what it would be. I feel this sensation more when I go this way, like diagonally. I'm not sure if that's me going crazy. I'm trying to figure out what it could be. I feel like a lot of things feel like cleaning a window somehow, but it feels like those windshield wipers. I feel like that's the sound my finger would be making on this.
I can only feel it sometimes. So I'm trying to figure out what it is based on. Sometimes my finger feels it. Yes, it's relatively smooth. Yes, I guess it would feel sort of like this table, like an IKEA desk table, I think. It feels like there's a slight amount of friction. Sometimes I feel more than other times. I'm not sure if that's just me pressing too hard. I guess it's neutral. I mean, I'm not entirely certain because sometimes I feel something, but for the most part, it feels fresh and clean relative to the other feelings, but not as much as glass would feel.
It's like a light rumbling, sort of like a tummy growling like a stomach growling a bit or like your hands on your dog or your cat or something. I don't know. I like it. It doesn't feel fuzzy as in fur, but fuzzy as in like [onomatopoeia] sort of like petting a bee. Yes, it's buzzy, I guess. Yes, it's a vibration. It's like rumbling a little bit under my touch.
This sort of feels like glass, but the first thing that came to my mind was a shaver. I don't know why. Yes, it sort of feels like I'm shaving something, mowing something down. I feel like a shaver or electric toothbrush, but you don't normally feel that with your finger. It's just that sort of sensation that I get from it in terms of something that I have felt before with my finger. I don't know. I am still feeling glass, so it still feels relatively smooth. I don't know. I don't feel hairs, but I feel like I'm pushing something away, but I don't feel what it is.
Okay. This again feels dirty, like not super sticky. I don't know. It sort of feels like my finger is getting dragged by something. I don't like it. I feel like some kind of friction. This one sort of feels like it's pushing me a little bit. The other one sort of felt like I was touching a kid's iPad that had spilled juice on it. This sort of feels a little bit like it's pushing back at me, and I don't know why. Okay, it feels like there's a bunch of stuff on it, and when you pass your finger by it, it's blowing at you. I don't know.
This one is a very mechanical vibration, like a machine that's running. Yes, this is how it would feel to maybe touch my computer when it's on the actual PC computer. I can feel it rumbling on the inside, but it doesn't feel like there's something on the surface so much. It just feels like it's rumbling from within. I guess it kind of tingles. It kind of tingles on my finger, yes. It's not super rumbly. It's just like a little tingle of something running underneath. I don't know. I feel like it would be something that would be warm because it feels like a machine. But I can imagine if something randomly started making this, I would be concerned if it wasn't what I was expecting. I wasn't expecting it to be a running machine, I guess.
It feels like I'm just getting lightly shocked, like [onomatopoeia]. Yes. Okay. It's not as strong, but it reminds me of an electric fence. I've been shocked by an electric fence, and that's quite strong. This isn't so strong. This has an electric current running through it. Yes, I can't associate anything, but it just feels like I'm working with --. Maybe if you're playing laser tag, this sort of feels like what it is like to shoot somebody or to be shot. You get a little rumble that there's a pass of electricity. It doesn't hurt. It's not scary. It feels like I felt something. It feels quite neutral.
This is quite smooth, still. The first thing that came to my mind was an ice rink after some people had been skating on it for a while. It's relatively smooth, but you can feel that there's some friction there sometimes. Some people have messed up the ice a little bit. If I think very closely about it, I can feel like there's some vibration on it that I sometimes feel more than other times. It's quite a light vibration that I feel. It's like a small little like snow ice pieces. That's what I feel like. It feels kind of smooth but also soft.
It feels like a sensation that I'd feel in some sort of arcade game where something's coming up at me. I'm going to go slower. Yes, it feels like there's some pulsing underneath my finger, but I can't attach it concretely to anything. It feels like one of those spaceship games where it's shooting at you, and then you need to avoid the missiles and shoot back. I'm a little stressed. Not very stressed. It just feels like something's coming up at me, and I don't know what.
