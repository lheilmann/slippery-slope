It feels like I'm getting electrocuted, like I'm touching a light ball or something with electricity in. It's summing on my finger sometimes, but not all the time. It's quick sensations whenever I drag my finger. I should take my finger off the plate. It makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable, I guess, because it's not that nice to feel like you're getting electrocuted. Yes, like touching a light bulb or something like electricity of some sort. Also, like the thing they have, the round thing where you touch it and then it electrocutes you when you take your finger off. Someone you should keep away from. Like quick lightning sounds, I think.
This feels like a glass with riddles in it or something that you can cut yourself on. It's also a little bit uncomfortable because it feels like your finger is kind of stuck. Like a small hole in the glass that your finger gets stuck in, and then it takes a little longer to get past it. It kind of feels like it has sharp edges. Yes, a broken phone glass, like when you've broken your glass on your cell phone, would be what I would attach it to. I can only feel it sometimes, not all the time.
I feel like there's a lot of friction and my finger is kind of stuck to the glass. I could feel it all the time. It's like a constant. I don't know what it's telling me, but it kind of reminds me of when I have to lock up my phone. That swiping motion. Like a lot of friction on my fingertip. I'm stuck to the glass. It's harder for me to move my finger away. It makes me feel a little bit trapped, I guess. I want to take my finger off, but I can't.
This one I have a hard time sensing. It feels like a very subtle sensation that's very quick as well. It almost isn't there, but it's just quickly, like a quick and very subtle vibration almost. I can mostly just sense the plate when there are no movements, but then quickly, there's like this vibrating thing that feels a little bit different. I think it kind of reminds me maybe of when I am using my phone, and I've turned on the sound, and I'm touching the screen while I get a notification somewhere else.
This feels very light, almost like there's no friction at all. My hand is just sliding. It's actually really comfortable. It's really nice. Maybe like soft waves or something because it's very calming. It makes me feel really calm. It's a really nice feeling.
This feels like a rough glass surface. It reminds me of the one at the beginning where I felt like I was lightly electrocuted, but at the same time, it feels like there's an uneven structure on the glass. Yes, there's some kind of uneven structure on the glass, but only sometimes, not all the time. It actually mostly reminds me of when I have to lock my phone up, and I can't press the password incorrectly. So it does like this vibration, and it says wrong password. Else I don't think I can attach anything to it.
It's very easy or comfortable to touch the screen. Yes, it feels like there's not much friction at all. It feels very light. It's a clean surface I'm touching, an even surface. It kind of reminds me of an ice skating rink before anyone has been on it. Very pleasant and comforting, like someone who's nice being around it. It makes me feel relaxed.
I can't sense that much different from before. It's still pretty easy, but sometimes it feels like there's a little bit more friction. I think just swiping on your phone or swiping on a window. I don't really attach any emotions to it. Yes, I guess because it feels like touching my phone, it just feels like a pretty regular feeling to have.
Sometimes the friction increases, and it feels again like you're getting electrocuted like a warning that you should take your finger off. The sensation is not there all the time. It's just some of the time. Yes, I would describe it as a more sticking emotion to the plate some of the time and then like a more easy sliding feeling the rest of the time. Yes, like a subtle warning that you should take your finger off or something is wrong. Maybe the friction when you touch a balloon.
It's pretty smooth, but it feels like I'm getting splinters in my finger some of the time. Yes, touching like a wood plate or something is what I attach it to. I don't know what sound I would attach to it, something that's like scratching. I'm kind of uncomfortable because I feel like I'm getting splinters in my fingers. At the same time, it's not too bad as I also feel it being very even and easy to slide my finger most of the time, but then when I get the sensation of the splinters, it feels uncomfortable.
This also feels like increased friction some of the time. I feel like I'm attached to the screen, but not constantly but some of the time. I feel my finger is getting stuck more to the screen. It's like a tingling sensation on my finger, but it also feels like I have something on my finger that attaches me to the screen. I guess it kind of reminds me of touching a really cold window with your finger, and then it being more attached when you have to take it off. Like a really needy person who has a hard time letting go.
This, again, feels very even but still a little bit more heavy movement across the plate. It's pretty comfortable because it's the same feeling constantly on my finger. I can just keep moving my finger on the screen. I don't have to remove it or anything because it's pretty pleasant. Yes, touching a window or touching a regular screen. Yes, I think touching a window, not when it's cold, but just like a regular body temperature glass screen.
This is like quick, very subtle sensations, where the friction is increasing. It's tingling on the tip of my finger, but I feel it very subtly, like tingly.  It's pretty calming. Maybe it just feels like swiping on your phone, and then you get, like a heads up, a notification, or anything. Yes, it's kind of like you have to be aware of something, but it's not uncomfortable.
This feels very even in a regular motion. For me, it's very similar to touching a glass window or screen again. It's kind of the same association, just like a slippery surface that's even. Everything is okay and normal. I don't have to pay attention to anything. I can just keep swiping or sliding my finger.
It just feels like an uneven surface. Like something is scratching. It kind of reminds me of when people have uneven walls, and there's stuff in it, and you go over with your fingers, and it's uncomfortable. It kind of gives me goosebumps. Yes, an uncomfortable feeling. You want to take your hand off.
This feels like a sudden sensation, almost like there's a broken --. Something is broken on the glass or increased friction. It's not all the time. It's just some of the time. It feels like my finger is getting stuck when I feel it. It makes me want to lift my finger, like remove my finger from it. It feels like I might cut my finger on it or something and then lift my finger and then put it back on on the other side.
