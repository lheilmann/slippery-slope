It's not that much friction at the moment, I would say. It's more like a really uneven surface. It's not that big things in between like they were in the warm-up period. It feels kind of normal, I think. There's no time in between the frictions. There's a little time in between these frictions, but it doesn't feel weird or anything. I think it would annoy me on a smartphone, though, if it was like this all the time. It kind of doesn't remind me of anything because it's a little like incy-wincy electrical shocks or something that are coming and going. I don't think I've ever experienced that before. It's nothing natural. It's not talking. It's not telling me to wake up or something because I think I've had that before. It's more quiet.
Yes, that's more demanding. That's more like a wake-up. Okay, those are bigger. Yes, bigger, more intense, more frequent, I think. Yes, more demanding, more like, do something. I can sense those little friction intervals, like I said before, like little electrical shocks maybe, just like a vibration through the finger. It's weird. It's glass, but it kind of does something with you. Yes, a little like electrical shocks, but it doesn't hurt or anything. Yes, it's maybe like a little vibration, like when your smartphone vibrates, but it's somewhere very deep in your pocket, and you just barely feel it. But you have it right on your finger. I think this one is not really calming. The last one was more calming, and this one is more intense, more demanding. It wants me to do something. It's like an alarm clock.
Yes, this one is more like the first one. It's more going. It's more constant. It's also funny because sometimes when you move your finger back and forth, it's only on the one side because there are those intervals where there isn't that much friction, and it's always on the one side. Like the glass is vibrating a little bit in some places. Yes, I mean, I shouldn't, I guess. Sometimes it feels like when you move your finger back and forth. It feels like there's always the sensation at the same part, and then on the other side, there's not that much sensation. I guess that's more because I've moved my finger in that certain way. It's a little like you can control what you're doing or what the plate is doing, what the glass is doing. These incy-wincy vibrations it's funny.
This one is more constant. It feels like it's more everywhere, and it's also a bit stronger, I think. It doesn't feel natural. It feels electric. It doesn't feel alive. This one is not calming, but it's also not making you feel awake or something. We had that one that was more like an alarm clock, and this one is more calm. It's also just more than the other ones before this, too. It's hard to say what it's really telling me. Maybe you could use it in a game or something to make it build up the tension. Yes, like excitement, maybe. And the feeling of something coming up, something happening.
Yes, those are very little, very small ones. It's like those very small snow thingies. I don't know why I associate nails with that. She's - why is she a she - very alive. She wants to do something. She's very squirrelly. She wants to move. She can't sit still. Somebody with ADHD or something. That one is more like it makes me feel alive. Yes, it's more natural, and it's more what life feels like. It's awake, and it's there. You can sense those little. I'll call them electrical shocks. They're very intense, and you can feel those in your finger. And then in between, there's just normal friction of the glass. It's telling me to do something, to move. I feel like I moved my finger more than on the ones before, too. It's a little like popcorn, maybe.
The intervals are longer in between them. It's like one of those book covers that have different surfaces, and when you go over the book cover at some point, your finger will be a little slower because there's another surface that you go over. Yes, it's like the book cover. If there's a little glue or something left on a table that you go over and you like stuck for a second. It doesn't feel like an electrical thing anymore. It feels like something I know, and that's why I can put it somewhere. It feels like something real. This is so weird. I don't think there are special feelings associated with that. It's nothing I would say that is, in particular, happy or sad about this. It's like normal. It happens.
Now we're again electrical. This is not natural. This does not feel very natural. This one is just vibrating a lot, maybe like an alarm clock would or a phone would when you get called. It vibrates just to tell you to wake up or to answer the phone. It's more quiet than the last person, just a little calm but also with a little energy because of those vibrations coming out again and again. It feels like a phone would when it would vibrate. That's what it feels like. It makes me feel like I should do something like answering my phone. It's a bit demanding with that. But that's also because it's been playing for two minutes. It's not as intense as a phone, I think.
They're closer together, and they kind of have a rhythm in there. It's like a long-short-short. This one is like it's not on my fingertip but more inside the hand. I guess it goes deeper inside. This one is more annoying than the other ones. Long-short-short, I had to think at the beginning if that was the symbol for SOS. It reminded me of Morse code. It's not. I don't think you need help. That's a little like somebody's trying to tell you something with it.
Yes, they're little again. They're very small and pretty intense, like [onomatopoeia]. They would be very annoying for a long time. I would say it might be what a migraine feels like, constant pain in your head. It's definitely telling me to get up and do something. It's very demanding. But it's also very quiet. So it might be like your sub-conscience when you're watching something on your phone while you should actually be studying. It makes me feel like there's somebody trying to tell me something here. It makes me feel like the glass is trying to talk to me and tell me to get up to do something. I can sense those little, very tiny electrical shocks, those little vibrations. And then there's a lot of friction in between. So there's a lot of just normal glass and then those little thingies again and again and again. They're pretty frequent.
Yes, those are way longer. Those are more quiet. They're more soft. They're also more intense than the last ones. I feel them more, but they're not that annoying because they're not that frequent. They're kind of smooth. I don't know. It reminds me kind of sleeping for some reason. It's quiet, and it's sleepy. It's snoozing. It's dreaming, maybe snoring. And it's quiet. It's in another world. I like that one.
This one has around about the same intensity, but it's more frequent again. It has not that long intervals. I'm just going to talk. A spring morning. There's stuff happening around. There are birds singing and flowers growing. I don't know. There's stuff happening in there. It's more bright more about living. Especially since the other one was more sleepy, this one has a bigger contrast. I'm very much full of life and cheery, cheerful maybe, happy. It's more like a long thing, but it's also pretty soft. And then towards the end of the sensation, it has this a little stronger message. So it's soft in the beginning.
They're pretty strong again, and there's no real pause in between them. I feel like even if there is a little pause in between them, it might still be just a little sensation instead of the big ones. It's maybe like if you get a lot of messages at the same time. Like if you get 50 pictures or something from a friend and then the phone is constantly vibrating, it's a little like that. It has those little pauses in between, and then it's just a lot of vibrations. This person would be very annoying, especially over a long time. Yes, definitely. It's a very not calm kind of thing. It's a stressful situation. Yes, I would associate stress with that. And it's just being all over the place like before an exam when you're kind of excited about what's happening but also a little scared.
They don't have a pattern that much. They're pretty much random. They have different lengths. They're all more or less of the same intensity, I would say. But I can't figure out a pattern with them. It's I can sense the friction. So I can sense a lot of friction, and then I move, and then it completely vanishes for a while. And then, at a random point, there's a lot of friction again. It's like tiny earthquakes. It's a little unsafe because you can't in any way control it or know what's happening. So if this was the feeling I had in a room, it would not be good. No, I can't associate any actions with it because they're so random. So there seems to be, even if you move it in the same way, the sensations won't be at the same place or anything. So it's not like you can control it in any way. It's just a surprise what's happening every time you move your finger.
This has a pattern again. It's pretty loud noises. It's a very, very intense one, not as quiet as the last ones, but pretty loud and also pretty frequent. That one's very demanding. It's not like something I felt before but maybe like something I've heard before because this one has the same frequency as an alarm clock might have. I don't think I felt it before, though. It's a very weird thing. While you move over the glass, you can feel those very big and intense sensations, just very big, intense vibrations in there. It's an exciting emotion. It's excited. Something's happening. Something's happening. You can anticipate that something will happen now. That's kind of what it tells you, I guess.
This one is very smooth. It's not that intense. It's very long. It's a very constant vibration. It's like real friction would feel. It's like going over a table that is kind of sticky, maybe, because there's so long that you feel them for a very long time. And then when they stop just for a second, then it's like not that sticky thing on the table. It's like that, I would say. It's very quiet. It's telling me to keep calm, maybe like it's tired. It's like the glass doesn't want to make those big sensations anymore. Yes, it's like moving your hand on a surface that is kind of sticky and not very smooth or anything. I mean, the glass is smooth, obviously, but the vibrations make it really unsmooth and give it something. It's like that paper with which you make surfaces smooth that red paper thingy, like this maybe.
I'm not even sure if they have a frequency. It's like the whole glass is vibrating. It's like those little vibrations. They're not that intense, but they're everywhere on the glass. I mean, I think they're always everywhere, but it also feels like they're there all the time. It's like an electric toothbrush that also vibrates all the time. It doesn't really talk to me. It doesn't really want me to do something. It doesn't really have something big to say. It's just there. There's no real message behind it or stuff like that like the other ones. It's very, very quiet, maybe even shy, but with much to say because there's a little vibration behind it, though. So she had something to say, but it wouldn't really come out. Maybe a little anger in the background. But very quiet.
