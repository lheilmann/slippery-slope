A stop and go feeling like keep going stop, keep going, stop, keep going stop, keep going stop. It feels like I am in a very narrow maze. I need to very quickly stop and turn another way and then go and then turn the other way and go. It's like a stop, go, stop, go, stop, go. Nothing really, I guess, other than stop and go stop and go. I think that's why I'm doing this. I'm constantly changing my path in some way. Very commanding, directive, I guess, in some way, but also very undecisive in some other way. I'm not doing anything right. A relationship? No, that's a joke. I instantly thought of Google Maps like when you're trying to get somewhere. Stop and go. Stop and go. Turn.
This is like a fast heartbeat. It's not very nice. It's disturbed in some way. [onomatopoeia]. It's not that good. It's stressful. The plate is stressed, or someone is stressed. It's difficult to save with actions, maybe like doing something where you're on edge. You have to perform in some way. You have to pitch something. You have to go to an exam. Yes, it reminds me of exam situations. It's a stressful sound.
This is soothing but also annoying because you can't feel it entirely. So it's more like, are you there or not? I guess, relax, but not like relax. It's more whispering relax. It's like constant feedback. It's always here like a massage but without really feeling the massage. I think it's when you're having a massage and there's music. No one's touching you, but it's before they start to massage you. It's the music that you constantly feel that you know that you're in a place where you have to relax.
This is annoying. This is also stressful. It's even more stressful because it's not that significant. It's not very good. It's like I need to pace up. I feel like I need to set up the pace, faster, faster, faster. I feel like I'm in a hurry. I'm running late. Someone who would needs to be on time. You need to make it.
I remember this one. This was relaxing. It's like calm squeezes in your hand or like a quick hug in some way but multiple times. It's like still fast vibrations. But the level is not that significant from where there's no vibration, and it fades out. That's nice. I'm thinking about my mom or dad in some way. It's caring.
I feel like it's trying to tell me something. Stop, but you need to go somewhere else and something like that. Stop, but you need to go somewhere else, and then it's trying to explain where to go. I want to understand what is being said because it bounces up and down. It's okay. It's significant. I guess someone who is trying to understand a friend who's telling me something or a colleague or someone. Wants to be understood.
This is also very relaxing. This is like a calm heartbeat. Yes, relaxing. I feel very good. Comfort like I'm safe. I feel like if I had to have a shot like a shot of like a vaccine or something, then if I felt this, I would be calm. Everything is gonna be okay in some way.
It's kind of like the same as the one before. If I had to compare it to the one before, then this is more significant and more in control. Authoritative. Caring. Authority.
It feels like I'm running. It's relaxing because I'm not running to a place. I'm just running. It's like footsteps, quick footsteps. It's like fast and continuous vibrations or sensations, but it varies. It's like a hard step, and then I'm jumping off again and then a hard step, and then I'm jumping off again. Free time. Enjoying the fresh air. Running in a beautiful landscape. Free. Just do what you need to do to play ahead in some way.
It's like a sick man a woman. Is it struggling? This is struggling. It's tough. It's like watching an old man walking down the street, and it looks like he's struggling. Yes, maybe seeing someone at the hospital. No actions, no. It's good in some way, but it feels like struggling. It's weird, yes.
I don't know about this one. It's like a bird chanting. Maybe being on vacation in a tropical place. Wake up, maybe.
This is annoying. It's not continuous, and it's not that significant. You don't know what it wants. God, this is annoying, super annoying. Tell me what you want. Jesus. Not good. Frustrated. A frustrating feeling. Like noise.
This is a heartbeat. This is very real. This is not nice. This is too real. Oh my god. This is not very nice. Oh my god. It's too real. I'm fingering a dead guy. I don't know. I'm alive in some sort of fucked up way. I can feel my own heart. I can grab my own heart and feel it. Yes, just very real. It almost feels not continuous, more like real heartbeats. It's not mechanical. It's very biological in some way.
This feels like high-pitched speaking in some way. High-pitched screams. It is scary. It's surprisingly not any particular feeling. It feels like somebody's screaming like constant screams in a mechanical way.
I don't know. Knocking on the door. Something's happening. Something is about to happen. Decisive. Four knocks, and then it stops, and then four knocks, and it stocks. Four knocks, and it goes on.
This is like ice is breaking or the glass plate is breaking. Danger. Be aware of something. Not good. A person who was in danger or is dangerous. I can't tell. Going ice skating, I think, but not in a safe place but on a lake in the country. That's not an action. I don't know.
