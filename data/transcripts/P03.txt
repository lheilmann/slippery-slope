It makes me feel a bit annoyed, actually. And it makes me feel like I'm more sweaty than I think I am. I'm sticking. Slightly irritating. The sensation feels like my finger is wet. I think this is the best way to describe it. It reminds me of running my fingers on the window of a car that's slightly damp, like a mirror, a damp mirror. It's like you're trying to do or describe it as like you're trying to do something, but you can't. It's sticky, but not sticky. That's really bad, sorry.
It's a little bit happy, not happy-happy, but I don't feel depressed or anything. It feels quite benign. I keep thinking of braille, but, I mean, I have very limited knowledge of what you can use this tech for, I think. It doesn't really remind me of anything I felt before. I don't think, not in terms of anything electric or anything. Tingly. It's like a tingly buzzing.
The first word that comes to mind is staccato, which is like a musical term, but it feels like a staccato. I don't feel anxious, but it gives me more of an anxious feeling than the previous one. This doesn't feel benign. I don't think I felt anything like this before. I'm not quite sure how it feels.
Just constant friction. It feels very constant. Difficult. Resistance. I think, emotionally, I feel the same way as I would if I were facing restrictions. It's a little bit irksome. No, I can't associate any actions with it.
I would describe this to someone else as more discreet. I think you almost have to be attentive to realize it's there. And then it's suddenly more periodical, I guess. It doesn't feel like much on my finger. It's like a small buzz, but it doesn't feel like an obstruction in the same way that the other ones did. It makes me think of when you pull a sticker off something, and there is a tiny bit of glue left, still, even though you got rid of most of it. You wrap your hand across it, and you stick. It's just a little bit annoying.
So it feels a little bit stronger, more like a little zing on your finger. I am blanking on adjectives. I think I would also describe this as staccato, a fast staccato buzz on your finger. It's not very imaginative. I'm not really feeling any emotions.
This feels like there's a lot more resistance all of a sudden, like jagged. It's a little bit irksome. I don't know. It's annoying. It feels a bit frustrating because it comes and goes, and then it is really resistant all of a sudden, and you don't expect it to be. It's like help. Where did that come from? It's a bit annoying. It makes me think a little bit of like walking through snow on grass. And you don't know what's underneath. And suddenly you step in a hole, and you're like, fuck, was this hole a minute ago, and then you're stumbling.
This one feels a bit like the sticker, but there's way more sticky stuff left on your CD. This is also nice when you leave it for a while, like a little buzz. Maybe it makes me think a little bit like polishing something to the point where it gets really squeaky clean. And it always wants to hear that squeaking noise from it. Maybe because it feels like there's slightly more resistance, but it's still quite constant.
This feels very constant but more like sludgy. I keep thinking, is it my finger that is sweaty? Or is it the thing that is just there all the time? It's annoying me a little bit, but I think it's maybe because I can't quite sense what I am supposed to be sensing. I feel it can't make its mind up, and I can't make my mind up. It doesn't feel like much on my finger.
This feels super resistant to me. This feels quite forceful. This one is a little bit aggressive. Sporadically. No, I don't associate much with it. I don't think I really felt it before. This feels a bit like being stuck in the mud or something.
This makes me think of a motor, a tiny little motor. It's slightly buzzing but more powerful. It's just like a buzz. It's like I would imagine a bee would feel like if it just sat on my finger buzzing. Excitement, maybe, is an emotion in a cutesy way. I don't think I feel satisfied. I feel like this would be before the satisfaction. This doesn't feel dominant to me. It feels like a little dog that's barking, and it thinks it's really dangerous, but it's actually really cute. It can feel like that.
This feels a little bit more intrusive again. I feel like we're back to the slightly more aggressive ones in a way like it feels a little bit more aggressive. I keep thinking of the sticker again. The sticker stuff, it feels like that. It feels like I expect to take my finger off, and there would be something on my finger that was in the way. It doesn't feel painful or annoying or anything. It's just like there's some kind of obstruction.
It's like a vibrator, but one that's not very powerful, just very low level. It's funny to me. It's slightly exciting as well, not necessarily sexually exciting, but like that buzz of excitement. No, I don't feel bored. I feel very in my head, exciting, mysterious, a little bit anxious.
I'm so sorry, I'm thinking of a vibrator again, but the ones that come with different vibration patterns because the switch is so dramatic. It feels very dramatic this one. Other than a vibrator? An engine again, maybe. Something slightly unstable. I don't think my finger feels all that much. I think I'd describe it as touching an engine that's sputtering right in the beginning. I think you need to think of an old-school engine that's just coming to life. And it doesn't like that. I feel a bit like that. That felt a bit different. Very jaggy. Spiky. Not very comfortable. It makes me feel a little anxious.
This is the toughest when you send it to the max level, the vibrator. Sorry for the audio. It makes me think a little bit of standing on the deck of a ferry when it starts moving, and you're surprised by how much you feel the vibration. I feel a little bit distressed. Yes, it feels a bit dominant. It's taking over a little bit. So it's more difficult to think because it's stressing me out.
This one feels so gentle compared to the last ones. You're almost not sure it's there. This feels very friendly by comparison to the other ones, much less stressful. It feels more kind, gentle. I feel that this is like the purring kitten of them. I wouldn't be anxious to have to feel the sensation again. It feels more chill. I would recommend this feeling for other people, but not necessarily the previous ones to experience. I think, emotionally, compared to the other ones, I'm a little bit relieved when I feel this one. Yes, maybe a relief.
