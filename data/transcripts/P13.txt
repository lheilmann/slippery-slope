Yes, so this is very light. Yes. It's a bit strange. It's a bit ticklish in a way. It's a bit ticklish. It's becoming a bit itchy in a certain way. I'm just trying because I think, also because we practiced this now and especially at the end, they were required rough ones and on my fingers is like, is this it? There's nothing more coming? I think it's just very slight --. I think it's more like when you touch someone else it's like --. How do you call the hard skin? Yes, you feel that it's a little bit rough, but still like a soft skin could have been. It's not unpleasant. That's what I would say. This is fine. Just a bit weird. I wouldn't know for the rest of objects which I could link to it. Because this sounds like the see, so I'm like, is this sand? No, it's not rough enough to be sand. As for the rest, trying to think. It's very gentle in a way. It's being nice. It's not being hard on you. It's very slight. I think for the rest. Yes, maybe they're nice, but also, I think if I feel this for a long time, it would become annoying, like, okay, we're done.
Okay, so I think because it feels like you're touching a surface which has some lines on them. And sometimes you come back to your line, and then your finger slights over. It's just like stripes. That's how I feel it for a bit. Okay, so is this my birthday? When I had a gift, and the wrapping paper had a pattern on it? So it's a good sensation. I'm unwrapping a gift. I think that's because you feel the thing on the wrapping paper. It's a happy sensation. I think it feels much more normal than the one just before because that was very short. This is much more like I'm just touching any object with, I don't know, a pattern on it. It feels quite normal. I could touch this with my finger every day, like objects or something to the rest. It's not negative, but I also don't love it. It's a bit weird because this kind of thing makes you want to stop your finger. I feel like if there's a rhythm which I can't because that's not allowed. What I feel like, therefore, I'm a bit intrigued because you're trying to disguise a rhythm, but I can't.
Okay, this one, I don't know if resistance is the proper word, but I feel like there's a little bit more resistance which is funny, but I don't know how it would look on the graph, but I feel like there's less of a peak. It's much more stable. I don't know. If it would have been an object, it's more like. I don't know, a slighter one. There's a slighter difference to someone else. Okay, I got my finger on the glass plate. I think because it does have some stops, but then it's just like someone just briefly brushes against your finger. But it is it's something that's not soft, but it's also it's not very unpleasant. I think it's awesome. Because of this sea sound, I'm feeling pretty peaceful. Yes, it's not bad because it's also pretty constant. It's repetitive. It's just like calming, maybe. Maybe that's the best emotion. I'm trying to think. I should know this more about what I touch. I try to think of something. No, because I was just trying to --. You know, when people take off their hard skin? And then one of those things, but then very, very slight, like very soft version, I think, from time to time, because of course, I feel like there's a pause in there. It's very soft. You're not going to take off any skin, but it's a bit of resistance.
This one is weird because already when we were practicing, this one makes me want to push on the glass thing because I feel like there's more resistance, but then I know that's not allowed. I think if we're talking about emotions just now --. Also, I think I just screamed when it just came on. I don't think it's more of resistance. It is not necessarily a positive thing. Because also, during practice, I was like, it's a funny feeling because I would expect to hear a sound when I touch something like this, which I'm not hearing at the moment. And I think it's also one of the things, if I would be touching this, I would stop. I realized, you know what. This is not something that is nice to patch or something. If this would have been like the skin of a pet, I'd be like, no, it's fine. It's a lot. I think, also in relation to the other one, it's very, I don't know, abrupt. I feel like my finger is overwhelmed, but it's also pretty constant.
Okay, I think I find this one more unpleasant than the other one just now. It's a bit eery. It's a bit weird. This is like, what's happening? It's a bit in the background. I think I was also just thinking it sounds like, what if I would put my finger in a black box and be touching this thing as this is one of the things I would just pull back. I think I'm getting some minor shocks or something. This is not good. I don't know. It feels a bit unnatural, I think. If this thing was a toaster, I'd be like, we need to buy a new toaster. I feel like I'm getting electrocuted. A thing that is very slight, but I feel like when someone sticks you with a needle but then slighter, like not really like that, but just a little bit annoying, just like, I don't know, prickly in a way. I am just trying to think. I feel like maybe it's a bit alien. I don't know if I get this like sensation from any other just object I was feeling because it's like you would get an electric shock that means something is happening. It's not like I'm just petting someone's pet or something. I'm touching something that just is an object.
Okay, yes, so this is much more like a beat or something. There's much more like a beat to it, but it's also quite strong. If compared to the one just now, it's much more present, I think. Also, with these things, you would expect there to be a sound, I think. Sometimes it's like you would be out, maybe in like a club, and you put your finger on the speaker. I think it's much more like that. It feels like it's just a vibration of a sound instead of a surface. I think because I associate it with music, it's a pleasant feeling. It's like a festive --.
This is very slight. I'm actually just second-guessing myself if I actually feel something, but I do feel something which is good. This feels more like you have just a glass thing, and someone sprinkles a little bit of sand on it, I think, but just like a tiny bit of sand, not a lot. A bit plain. I don't want to be mean. It's just very plain. Yes, but because I'm moving my finger more, you do feel a little vibration in the background. So maybe the person has layers. Who knows? I like this one. Because the longer I was feeling it, the more I felt, which is nice. It feels good. Yes, but I think it's also maybe a little bit of a nervous speech in the end. I think the longer I'm listening to this like it's something going to happen? It's this build-up, so maybe that's also an emotion.
I never played the violin. No, like when you touch a guitar string, but more like a bass guitar. It also feels a little bit like this. Yes, so I think if you'd be touching this for a long time, you would get more like hard skin on your fingers. I think. I am looking for a more specific word than rough. This is a little bit rough. Now I can't get the guitar out of my mind. Yes, that's the same person with the bass guitar. Yes, I'm trying to think of more adjectives. Quite okay because it doesn't feel very alien. It feels like this could just be any object. I'm more familiar with it. I think that's maybe the adjective that I was looking for. It feels like a familiar, natural, normal like I'm not being experimented on, kind of feeling.
I feel like this is similar to the ones I just had. It's much more intense, the intervals, I think, when it comes back. Someone who's just like tapping on the glass or something, and they want to tell you something. It's much more urgent, just like I have a message to tell you. I think if you think about an iPhone or something and then we just put this in your iPhone screen, this is like your mom is calling, obviously. It's very invasive, I think. I'm like, okay, I need to pay attention to something because something or someone is trying to tell me something. I'm more alert. I think there's something I should pay attention to. And this is reminding me just like a trigger or warning or alert. Very, very present. Sort of be like, okay, now maybe it's time for you to shut up. Yes, no, I think so. Doesn't sound nice.
Okay, this is one of the confusing ones because it's very constant. Now it just feels like you're maybe touching a rough paper or something, I don't know. Paper with a certain, I don't know, pattern in it like special paper, I don't know. It's much more smooth. I think this could be wrapping paper, I feel like. What else could I relate it to? It's not rough enough to be a kiwi. No, but like a very bald kiwi. I don't know. I think just as like the wrapping paper, and like the kiwi, it's like a wrapping of something. I don't know why that's telling me but more like packaging or something.
Okay, there are big pauses in this one. But then it's less invasive as the other ones, which is more annoying. This is more like it's very rough. Okay, so when I was younger, it's a long story, but --. Okay, so my brother has Down syndrome, and we did a lot of dolphin therapy. It feels a little bit like the skin of a dolphin which is very specific. It's not rubbery but, therefore, so oh my god, dolphin skin happy. I don't know if anyone else said that. I think it's nice but also because of my past experience I'm like, it should be wet because a dolphin is in the water. So I'm like, what? It's a bit weird in a way. But also it's a bit confusing because it's only for a very short amount of time that you feel it. I think it's also a bit intriguing if I'm talking about emotions. I'm trying to feel it better, but it's not giving me enough time to properly feel it. So I can't tell for certain if it's a dolphin.
I don't think I like this one. I think if you would visualize it, there would be a lot of flashing lights right now. I don't know why but for some reason. Yes, it's not pleasant. Doesn't feel that nice. I think, with this one, I'm just more tempted to just lift my finger off the glass. I'm like, you know, there's something about it. Yes, I think also just my body --. It's just my fingers like this is --. Something's wrong. I think this one feels just like the other one, more like an electric current. And I'm like, whatever I'm touching is not safe. This is not something you should be touching. So I think a bit of like danger maybe. Or like something is not right.
Just trying to think if I can relate it to something. I feel like it's like I'm touching something with like a ridge on it. A person with rough edges or something. That would make the most sense. Yes, so that's not necessarily bad or negative things, more like, maybe the person has issues or no clue. It feels a bit weird because I would not know what object to picture linked to this thing because it's a very big difference in what I'm touching. I think I'm quite okay with like --. Some of the others I wanted them to stop. I'm quite okay with feeling this one, so I feel quite good. I'm more intrigued. I think with this one, I'm like, I want to know now what the thing could be or what person this person is. No, so it's quite pleasant. It's not too alien in a way. But it's also a bit confusing because I can't relate it to an object quickly at the top of my mind.
It's funny because, in the beginning, it felt like nothing, and then it really came out of nowhere. It is a build-up, or my fingers are just confused. I'm trying to think about what I'm feeling. It's a bit like the paper one I just got before. Okay, it's good. I felt that, though. I'm not just bullshitting. No, but there is something in the background I feel like with this one as well. It feels like, with this one, there is like a beat in the background. So it's much more music-related in my mind, I think. So what is it telling me? It's not really like the other music thing because that was much more like a beat. And this is more like, do you know the movie Jaws, like something's coming. It's much more like that. Where I'm like okay, so I think emotion wise I'm like, Jaws is like, there's a shark coming for you. So it's more like a bit tricky, more like danger, a bit more like thriller movie like, like there's someone sitting behind you with a knife kind of thing. So it's a bit horror, a bit scary, a bit murderous in a way.
Okay, this feels more like the one from just now but then without like the Jars thing behind it. So like you just took away a layer or something in a way. This feels much more normal. It's just like a rough surface you're touching. I'm trying to see if I can come up with a better example than wrapping paper. No, it's a bit more rough. It's more a bit unshaven but very slight subtle. I feel very slight. It's not bad. It's not like a stubble that's very prickly. It's a very slight stubble. It feels normal. It's not even an object. It's like another person. It's nice. It's intimate because you're touching someone's stubble, like someone's face. Yes, so it's much more intimate. Someone has not just shaved, but I feel like it's tunnel vision now. It's nice. I think it reminds me more of my dad, maybe in that way.
I am just trying to figure out what I'm feeling. Sometimes it's better to take a little bit more time, I feel like. I'm trying to think of how this one is different than the other ones. This one is a bit confusing because I don't know if I'm feeling a surface or whether it's more like electric pulses or the thing I was talking about, a beat or not. I don't know. I feel like this is just a weird cocktail of the ones I just felt. It's not unpleasant. I just have no clue what's going on. I think because it's a little bit like you're touching a surface, there is some kind of current going through your finger. But then it's like a weird mix because there's also a pause in it. It's not constant. It's not stable. It's a bit putting you off. If you have to try to find a word, it's chaos. I have no clue what is happening.
