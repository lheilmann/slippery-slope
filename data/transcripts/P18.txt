This is a very light sensation, like a beating sensation. It's like very light running in a way. It's a little bit sad. It doesn't feel happy. It's a bit too light to be happy. It's too slow to be happy, so it feels a bit more like a sad emotion. I sense slight touch and light touch or something maybe like small pebbles, small rocks. It could also be a small heartbeat just because of its beating and slides, more of a calm heartbeat. I think the only thing that comes to mind that it reminds me of is then a heartbeat, yes. But that can probably be applied to any beating sensation but a light heartbeat.
This is a bit weirder than the other one. It's not a beating, a bit more random. Still very light. It still feels like walking on pebbles, small rocks. Maybe using an eraser on paper can be associated with this one because it's a bit random at times and feels like you're rubbing on something. It doesn't really make me feel like a lot. It's just a bit too random to get a grasp on what it is. If this was a person, I would characterize them as a bit chaotic but still calm in a way because it's a very light sensation but maybe a bit stressful.
This feels more forceful. It's more putting the brakes but still a bit random and chaotic. It feels like it's trying to stop my finger but not doing a very good job because it's a bit too light. It's stronger than the other ones but still too light to stop my finger. It feels like when you ride a bike on rocks, and it kind of vibrates. It is a bit angrier than the other ones because it's a bit more forceful but not too angry, just slightly mad.
This feels more like sliding along. I don't feel hindered in my finger movement. It's more like ice skating. I feel like it's helping me along. It feels a bit happier. It's telling me to keep moving and not stop, just keep moving my finger. It's like ice skating, not really being able to stop. It's a very calm sound, a bit high pitched but still not that it hurts but still calming like a very high operatic voice but in a calm way.
This one feels angry, like it wants me to stop moving. It's also a bit random, a bit crazy, a bit out of control. I sense, I think, if I've before sensed pebbles, I'm more sense like heavier rocks now, or like maracas music instruments or something like that. It makes me feel a bit more annoyed because it feels like it's working against me and not with me. This is an angry person, a forceful person, but, yes, angry.
When I'm moving my finger at this one, it feels like I'm hitting some smudge on a screen or like some pains or something like that. Then I'm smudging it along the path of my finger. It's not really stopping me, but it's something in my way that I'm dragging along. It's not that forceful. It's nicer. It's telling me to keep going, but instead of just letting me go, it's more pushing me along every time I feel it. It's a beating sensation, very periodic. It's a bit happier, more like dancing to beats. It's more like a heartbeat, this one. It gives us two beats and then a longer break.
This one is very light. It feels like something is trying to break through the surface, but it can't because it's too light. It's more like grain or rice when you hold some rice in your hand, something small, maybe smaller than rice like couscous or something else. It feels calming. It's not too aggressive. It's still nice and light but very grainy when it hits me. It's a beating sensation, very rhythmic.
This is, again, a bit like ice-skating, but whereas the other one before was very constant, then this one I can feel each step I take or each skate I take. I don't know what it's called. Every time I take a step with the ice skates, I can feel it here just sliding along. It's a very smooth sensation and a very light, happy one. It's a very, very clear sensation. This is not very grainy. It's telling me to keep going, keep moving along. It's also this one-two beating that is just repeated all the time. Though, it is slowing me down a bit with every step I take.
This one's a bit more sticky in a way. I feel like there's a sensation all the time, but there's a beating on top of that sensation. It's kind of holding on to me, a lot more friction all the time. And still, every time there's a beat, a more intense beat, there's kind of trying to hold me back. It's more persistent, a bit, don't want to say angry, but, yes, persistent. This person is not someone who's backing down. It's someone who gets what they want. It's kind of like pulling a car in the snow, and your tire is flat. So every time it goes around, then there is more of a hard hit.
This one's a bit happier, like small bunnies jumping. It's more like summertime. It's very light but again with the beating like a heart. It feels like it wants to tell me something. It feels kind of light, just knocking on my finger but a very light knock not with any intentions to hurt or be angry but to tell something. It makes me feel happier. It feels more like summertime. Like it's not cold outside. It feels more like laying on the beach and watching the sun and then feeling your own heart at the same time.
This one's a bit more intense, a bit faster. It feels more like shaving even though they may be all should have felt like that. This one feels more like shaving. It's also trying to stop my movements. It's a bit angry. It's like the shaving sound, but higher pitched because it's it feels faster than that. It feels a bit annoyed, a bit angry like it's teasing someone. I sense four fast beats and then a short break. Each of the beats is very fast, high-frequency.
This one's a very light, constant beating. It's like the ticking of a train but a model train, not an actual train. It's a bit hard to associate it with anything except from that. I sense of very light constant beating like a ticking clock or a model train. It's very neutral, just going along, not really sad or angry, just neutral.
It feels a bit softer. It feels like every time I feel it, it's gradually becoming harder and then softer again because, like there's a curve to it, some attack and release. This is a very calm person, a very mother-like person, somebody who won't really get angry quickly. It feels like it's easing me into the sensation. That's being nice to me. It makes me feel calm, relaxed.
This one feels like it's moving along too quickly for its own good. It feels like there should be a constant beat, but there isn't, really. It's a bit chaotic. It feels like someone's running and falling all the time, falling over themselves. It feels a bit in a hurry to get somewhere. It feels like somebody is being chased. Just like when you're working out, and you can't really do anymore, but you have to keep going. If this was my heart, it's telling me to stop and take a break. It feels stressful. It feels a bit scared.
It's a very light sensation. There is some rhythm to it, but it's hard to feel because it's too light. I sense this ticking in the distance. It makes me feel like I need to wake up. An alarm is ringing somewhere but far away. This is a person who knows where they're going, what's on their way. It's going there at a brisk pace, keeping the same tempo.
This feels like many short sensations, kind of like small fireworks, jumping jack, I think they're called. It's telling me that something is going on somewhere, but it's a bit too light for it to be nearby. It makes me feel interested. It's catching my curiosity. It feels very light on my finger. It feels dampened like it could be louder, but it's not coming through.
