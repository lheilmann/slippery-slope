This one feels like it's really hard to actually move it. There's some friction, like little hills. I don't know if I can explain that. Maybe a good way to explain it is like it feels like the glass is getting stuck on my finger, like the little parts, like making a fingerprint. It's uncomfortable. Maybe it feels like there's something on the glass. Someone has spilled something. Yes, it feels like when you spill something in the kitchen and then it's a bit sticky and you try to wipe it away with your finger, and then everything gets nasty. So it's nasty. It makes you feel nasty. It's like something wants my finger to get stuck on the glass. And it probably is going to make a really gross sound if I would hear it.
Somehow, this one feels even worse in some cases, especially when you slide your finger up. If I could hear it right now, I think it's gonna make a creaking sound. It feels like there's a bit of vibration when I move it faster, a bit like electricity balls in those science centers. But it also makes me want to put all my fingers there. Yes, electrical buzzing. So it's maybe a sound a bee makes or a beehive. If I would have to put a sound again to this one, for instance, it's maybe like a motor running. It's not good.
This one is like it has the same motor running, like what I said, like this kind of electrical feel, but it's more smooth. I feel like maybe if I were playing a game on glass or like a touchscreen, then this one would show that something has been done like a goal has been reached. It's not a nasty buzz like the last ones. It feels like I'm doing something. If I look right at my hands, I would imagine maybe I'm drawing with a paintbrush, a  rusty paintbrush. It's not in a bad way. It gives a sense of accomplishment, maybe. It's exactly that. You have a brush at the top of your finger, and you're brushing something away, or you're painting a picture if I would move it faster. Yes, I guess that's a good explanation. It's like a little brush on my fingers.
Okay, this one is like the hum, what I was talking about before. It feels slower, more of a deeper voice if there would be a voice. It's not as pleasant as the last one. And it makes me feel like there is something wrong. If I had to put it as an adjective or in a story, then it would be dark in some way. So it gives negative feelings, but not in an irritating way like the first two, but more sinister. Or again, you're playing a game, and something bad happens. Yes, it's lower. If this was music, it would probably be bass or something.
Yes, okay. This one feels like you're running, and you stumble upon all the hills in your way. I think there's something that stops the movement, like intervals. At least it feels like it. It looks like an application is lagging. So it's not nice. It makes you pissed off. Irritating. It's probably someone very neurotic or prompt or impulsive behavior. I don't know. I guess exactly like computer lag. It makes you impatient. Come on, do something properly now.
Okay, so this one is smooth, and then it hits a tiny bit of weight. I don't know. It reminds me of the sea or a very calm sea. I am not really sure because it doesn't really remind me of anything else I've experienced before in a touchscreen, especially. It feels dormant, like something is not right, or it's starting up. It's passive, to be honest. I don't know. A shaver that doesn't work. It feels like it confuses my finger because it's not really still, but it's also not really constantly buzzing or sending this vibration. So I think my finger is really confused. It's not something I would want to feel, actually. I think.
Yes, this one is really disruptive, again, because there are these longer intervals of just nothing. So it feels like I can do whatever I want, and then something just kind of grabs a finger. So it feels very restrictive and not in a good way. I mean, restrictive is not in a good way. It's annoying, oppressing. So it holds you back. It doesn't slide your finger. You expect a very smooth slide, but it disrupts that. I could imagine it would be used for something that tries to slow you down. Yes, because it gives this phase-like feel. I can imagine you're hurrying somewhere. And then somebody is like, no, don't go. It pulls you back from your clothes or something.
It's passive, quiet. I don't know. I don't like this kind of people. It's like someone who lives with their five cats because it's a very low and annoying little buzz in the background. It was kind of hard for me to first even detect it and not even detect it. But I couldn't really understand if it was the buzz or my finger against the glass. Yes, it's telling me it's very coarse. It feels grainy. I'm sliding my finger across some small grains. Yes, I don't know. I've dropped salt, and for some reason, I'm doing eights in that with my finger.
This one feels barely noticeable. I couldn't understand at first that there was some kind of a pattern. It feels like it's just my finger on something sticky or grease. I don't know. Sweat on it or something. It's a bit disruptive. I don't know what to even say about this one. It's not something you would meet, like using a touchscreen in real life, I think. I guess maybe it has this lagging as well. So like when you're at the McDonald's that have these touchscreens, and sometimes they don't work because stupid kids use them too much. And then it's you ordering. That's how it feels. Impatient. Those got damn kids. I just want my burger. But something is not right. I expect smooth sailing.
This feels low again, like something in the background. I'm touching a tiny motor, but it's not too vibrating. But it also, maybe, reminds you of pain. If it's tooth pain, it's something in the background. It feels like it's just aching or vibrating. I think it's someone very stable, actually someone who is so confident and maybe like a leader. Yes, it's like a stable, confident person. I already said stable, continuous, in a way calming, maybe because it doesn't change. It's just going to continue until you turn it off.
If I was talking about something sticky before, then this one feels even more. I was thinking for a second that there was something on my finger. Yes, it looks like I've taken jam, poured it on my counter, and now I'm just playing around with it. Yes, this is not a good feeling at all. Yes. Sticky. Glimmered. I think it's even oppressive. I can't move my finger properly. It's literally stopping it. It's not actually stopping, but it really feels like you just put something sticky here right now and there on the glass. It's telling me I should clean the glass. I don't know. If this was like an application of the touchscreen, and I would feel this, I would probably make a restart. It obviously signifies that something is not correct.
This one feels alive. It's good to touch, but you can still feel there is some kind of action happening with whatever I'm interacting with. It's not disruptive. It's not too much in your face, but it gives you enough feedback to understand that you're actually interacting with something. It's a positive thing. Maybe success because it does make you feel like something is happening. Something is working. So it doesn't give you negative feelings that there's an error or there's a lack, or something is wrong like some of the previous ones. But I think it's because it's also continuous and not so much disruptive as a feeling. So it's like a positive one. I think it reminds me of kitchen appliances like any kind of appliances that use batteries or a hairdryer, maybe a mixer, even though a mixer is actually a way more strong vibration. But I think it's like when you hold it in your hand, then you cringe, then the vibration becomes less, and it resembles this one maybe.
This one, I guess, is some of the sticky ones. It actually doesn't feel as restricting as the one that was more or had a pattern. It's because I guess it takes you by surprise, and then it gives you this false idea that everything is nice, and then it suddenly has this [onomatopoeia] that stops your finger. It doesn't feel good. So it's a bit startling. It makes you feel tricked because, as I said, it gives a good feeling everything works. Then suddenly, it's sticky. It reminds you of boundaries, but I know it's in my head, so if I were playing with a box or something physical. When this disruption happens, it feels like I'm hitting something physical with my finger. So maybe even though I know, it happens at random places, but since I'm drawing actual shapes with my finger right now and this tends to happen at certain points. It maybe gives this 3-D imagery.
That one actually feels good, a bit, for example, like a purring cat. But it also feels like I'm actually doing an action like moving my finger. It actually gives some kind of results. I'm drawing some shapes. It's a good feeling. It doesn't feel like a disruption. I think it's because it's prolonged. I don't see that as a person at all. I see it more like I'm doing art, more of an action. If I had to describe it may be fun, creative. But that's because right now, it gives in my head this imagery of I'm doing art. And I'm making this fun collage or a painting or something. So it might be biased. Purring. Fun. Creative. Colorful. Yes, fun. This is fun. It actually feels nice.
This one feels like a machine that is pumping out something. So it has a steady purring or steady hum. And then there are sudden weird outbursts, but you can't really explain. Yes, it feels like I'm interrupting something. But it's a machine at work. I shouldn't be touching it. I don't feel like I'm doing anything with my finger here. So it feels like I'm interrupting some kind of process. It doesn't give me any kind of feeling of control at all. As I said, I don't know, a machine pumping out packages like in the Amazon workplace or something like that. They come out of the line. I don't know. This one is a strange one. It doesn't really seem to have any kind of consistency of movement. It doesn't feel like I know the rest of them. No matter how I move my finger, it also doesn't matter. But this one just feels completely off. The one I said there was more drawing at least gave an illusion that I'm doing something, but this one is nothing.
Okay, talking about doing nothing, this one also feels that I'm having some impact. It's just like if there were little hills that are kind of hairy, and I'm brushing above them. I'm searching for them with my finger. It almost feels like I could trace some kind of pattern or some kind of landscape. There's actually nothing there. Or if the glass would have different textures, this would give a different texture like hair or something. I think of an old grandma or grandpa, the one who sits in his chair and reads newspapers, just complaining about TV or radio or something. It's loving and nice. Or a cat that purrs, maybe, but a nice cat, not the one who attacks you. I feel alive, maybe. I know I said cat and grandma, but I meant more like nature-wise of like different patterns and different landscapes and materials and textures. And if I wouldn't see the glass or not look at it, I would imagine that there would be whole ornaments of stuff and a landscape of different colors and textures and stuff. It's telling me there's something I can't see. But I can discover that this was a game for kids or something, or you can touch somebody else, a blind person. I would be touching someone's face or something.
