I'm not sure if I can feel this that much, but maybe a small prickling. Or is there even any? It's difficult to tell. A small prickling, yes. It feels like a small prickling on my skin, like a not very long but pointy needle. It doesn't hurt at all. I can just feel it.
This one feels more magnetic, like I'm being pulled towards the plate. My finger is being pulled towards the glass plate. I don't know. Maybe if you play with magnets and then you try to put your hand or finger in between, and then there's this weird force. Well, we know what the force is. It feels pleasant. It's not too much.
This one is harder to describe. Maybe a small pinching. I'm going in the wrong direction or something. Like a low-frequency pitch, I think.
Yes, I can definitely feel this one. It feels like tiny bubble wraps. That's like different fields over the texture. It's fun. It feels pleasant. Yes, I'm enjoying it. Yes, it's softer, like taking my finger and putting it or stroking some sandpaper, but it's way softer than sandpaper. So it feels pleasant, actually. It's a very mellow, chill person.
This one seems very subtle. Yes, I feel content. I think it feels like when you get a hot tub, a Jacuzzi, or something, and then you have the lowest of the lowest setting, like tiny bubbles. It's very subtle. It's very subtle to me, at least.
Nothing because I really can't feel this one.
It feels slippery, light, very light. When you're skiing, and you feel very light on the snow when you go down, this is what it feels like. It's like I'm barely touching the snow. I'm on top of the snow, not sinking. Yes, like skiing or maybe ice skating as well like a very soft hum or something [onomatopoeia].
Yes, this one is a bit more coarse. It feels more heavy on my finger. I don't know how to describe that. It's hard to associate it with a feeling. I have to say. It almost feels like a pulse, actually, now that I think about it, like a heartbeat. Yes, it feels more heavy than the last one.
Running or some kind of workout or something.
Taking your hand through grass. It's pleasant. It's a pleasant feeling, very light also, very free, not restrained, yes.
I don't know. It seemed like when, it's a weird thing, but if you have ever been together with --. If you have a friend that's a bit slow in his head, this is what it feels like. It's a bit behind. Yes, maybe some high-powered training like cycling, swimming. You want to push yourself, actually, when you hear this, feel this, I mean.
This one feels very subtle as well. This actually feels a bit like sandpaper, like a very fine-grained piece of sandpaper. Maybe a tiny bit of uncomfortableness, I would say. It's not unpleasant, but it's not pleasant per se.
Yes, [onomatopoeia]. Yes, this one feels like the electrical balls you had as a child where you had electric feedback. I think we also got from that. You put your hand, and there were like these little lights through your hand. I can't remember what it's called. It feels like a very subtle caress. It feels exploratory, like something new. An adventurer.
That's really hard to describe. A little tingling, maybe. It's telling me to relax.
This feels like tiny electrocutions in my finger. I have been punished. I don't know. It's, but It makes me feel energetic, I think, like getting ready to pump. Yes, if you've ever touched an electrical fence, this is just tiny, tiny bits of it and only going through your finger. Friction, small pulses.
This feels like small bubbles exploding, but it's tiny tiny explosions. Yes, like I'm touching small bubbles, and as my finger goes along, it pops them. Yes, this is kind of fun. I should keep going.
