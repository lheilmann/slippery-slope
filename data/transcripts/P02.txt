It reminds me of something creaky, like a seesaw or something. It also feels like when you run your fingers down a knife-edge as well. No, I don't feel excited. I guess I would just describe it to someone else, as I said before, like when you run your finger down a blunt knife, like a kitchen knife, and that has got a rugged edge. No, it doesn't feel dominant. It feels quite neutral, I would say. I associate it with sawing something. I would say it feels slightly uncomfortable.
I would say it feels quite similar to the last one. I would associate it with when you hold a balloon and then you put your arm down it. No, not your arm, your hand down the balloon and feel the, what's the word --. God, I don't remember the word. I don't really associate any adjectives with it. It just feels squeaky on my finger. It also makes my hand feel numb as well. It makes me feel slightly distressed, actually, more than the last one. I don't feel satisfied, no.
ni It's interchangeable. I think it feels like you're waiting for something to happen because it's going smooth and then hits the glass because there's nothing really happening with the vibration. So it's just your finger on the glass. It does remind me of something, actually. It reminds me of the fingerprint button on an iPhone. That's what it is. It's quiet. I would say it feels quite quiet.
I would say it's quite similar to the last one when I said it felt like the fingerprint button on an iPhone. It feels like when you unlock an iPhone with your fingerprint but maybe five times stronger than that, to be specific. It's maybe like an alarm clock. I wouldn't say it reminds me of something I felt before.
Yes, it feels quite smooth, like putting your finger in water. I don't feel excited. I would say it's boring. Yes, this doesn't really feel like much is happening with this one. No, I don't feel distressed. I do feel slightly satisfied. No, it doesn't feel dominant.
This one feels even smoother than the last one. Really random, but the first thing that comes to my mind is icing sugar, like when you hang your hand in it, and it feels really soft. It feels like when you use a nice pen, like a smooth pen. Other than smooth? It's nice, I guess.
I don't really like this one. It feels a bit scratchy. It feels like rubber, like putting on rubber boots or wearing something rubbery, touching something rubbery. It makes me feel uncomfortable, I would say. No, I don't feel excited. I feel slightly distressed. I don't feel satisfied.
I feel like this reminds me of something, but I can't think what it is. It feels a little bit like before, like rubbing a balloon but on a lesser scale. It feels familiar, but I can't put my finger on exactly what is. I think it feels tiring, I would say.
Again, this one feels quite similar to the ones before. It makes me feel quite agitated because it's smooth, and then you can feel stronger vibrations, I think, but you don't know when they're coming. It actually feels a little bit like chalk on a blackboard kind of thing. I would say it's unpredictable. Yes, I would say it makes me feel a little bit nervous. No, it doesn't remind me of anything I felt before.
Yes, this one feels a lot stronger. It feels like you're getting an electric shock. It's like, I don't know if you have it in Germany that game, what's it called? It's like the little man on the operating table. And then you have to put the organs into him using the little tools. And then it gets a shock if you hit his body. No, I don't feel satisfied. Yes, it probably makes me feel more excited than the other ones so far. Yes, it does feel dominant.
This one feels like or reminds me of a heart beating. I don't know if it does remind me of something. I would say it's quite consistent, quite rhythmic, and quite calming. I would say it sounds like a clock. I would say it feels quite smooth on my finger. I would describe this to someone else as having constant but subtle vibrations under your finger.
This makes me feel like I'm in Ved Siden Af. Literally, the first thing that came to my mind was being in a nightclub. It's quite frantic, intense, a little bit scary. It feels like a bomb that is going to explode or something. It feels really strong on my finger. Yes, it feels like when your skin is pulsing, maybe a bit sore or something.
This one feels like I'm using a pencil. I hate using pencils. I've already used the word scratchy, but it also is quite scratchy. It's not very nice. It feels like when you run your finger along a smooth surface, but maybe like a wooden surface. But then there's a bit of wood sticking up, and then it's like a splint, just like that. It just feels uncomfortable, I think.
This one feels like dramatic music in a movie. It's like a bad bit in a movie. Someone is being chased or something. It feels like it goes from low to high on a loop. It reminds me of those lights that you get in science museums, and it's like a globe. And there's a light and then when you touch it the light comes to your finger and then you can move the light. It feels like that. I don't know.
This one is like a frog croaking. It feels scary, actually. Because the vibrations are quite low, and they get faster. It feels like your fingers are being chased. I don't know if it does remind me of anything from before. It is quite intense, quite dominating, quite rough as well.
I do not like this one. And it feels like sandpaper. And it feels quite frustrating. It feels like you want to wear it down to make it smooth, but then you can't. So it's quite annoying. It feels like I said, like sandpaper, just like holding a bit of paper or a bit of cardboard.
