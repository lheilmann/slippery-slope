      "text/plain": "array([[\"This one feels like a train or a horse. Excitement is not necessarily the first word I'd be like --. I feel excited, but it's not relaxing particularly. It feels like you're jogging or something. Yes, it's quite rhythmic, I would say. It's quite pulsating, quite up-beat or urgent or whatever. But it doesn't feel alarming to me anyway.\",\n        \"I'm so sorry, I'm thinking of a vibrator again, but the ones that come with different vibration patterns because the switch is so dramatic. It feels very dramatic this one. Other than a vibrator? An engine again, maybe. Something slightly unstable. I don't think my finger feels all that much. I think I'd describe it as touching an engine that's sputtering right in the beginning. I think you need to think of an old-school engine that's just coming to life. And it doesn't like that. I feel a bit like that. That felt a bit different. Very jaggy. Spiky. Not very comfortable. It makes me feel a little anxious.\",\n        \"It's more sporadic. It feels like it's stopping me more. It feels like it's telling me to stop. I'm pushing, and something is pushing back. I'm trying to get somewhere, but there is a force exerted in the other direction. And it's more like in waves, like not constant. It's trying to tell me to stop and not just be in the way, but actually trying to tell me something like, don't go this way. I feel some kind of stubbornness. I get to feel more stubborn and more want to push against it. It feels like there's something with a thought behind this, but it wants me to do something.\",\n        \"So this feels very turgid. It feels very slimy and thick. I can feel my hands are sweaty, but the surface is also very resistant, more resistant than a surface can be. And there's a slight sensation of pulsing, not major. It's telling me you're not welcome. It tells me that I'm in a hard zone that I'm stuck in the mud. Frustrated. Slow. Sludgy.\",\n        \"Honestly, nothing. I'm just gliding my finger across the screen. It's just like a normal window. It's kind of squeaky, a little bit. No, it's really just like a windowpane, I guess. Maybe I have really hard fingertips. I don't know.\",\n        \"I don't like the feeling of this at all. It feels like your fingers are getting stuck in something like a strange vibration sensation as they get stuck. So it feels like I shouldn't be doing it. As if it was a screen, it would be --. Yes, I guess the sensation is sticky. It's just not particularly pleasant. I don't like the feeling. As you bring your hands across it, it feels like there's little vibrations going into your fingers way more than the other ones. I don't like that. It's a bit uncomfortable. Also, it's slightly reminding me in the pattern that it feels on my fingers of the iPhone alarm. It's got a sequence to it, and you can sort of feel that in your fingers.\",\n        \"Okay, yes, so this is much more like a beat or something. There's much more like a beat to it, but it's also quite strong. If compared to the one just now, it's much more present, I think. Also, with these things, you would expect there to be a sound, I think. Sometimes it's like you would be out, maybe in like a club, and you put your finger on the speaker. I think it's much more like that. It feels like it's just a vibration of a sound instead of a surface. I think because I associate it with music, it's a pleasant feeling. It's like a festive --.\",\n        \"I feel a little bit like a [onomatopoeia] in the finger like [onomatopoeia]. Again, this reminds me a lot of the sound that they play in all movies when there is like a cartoon walking like [onomatopoeia] like one step at a time. Yes, walking, it is definitely like a cartoon walking. This one almost makes me feel happy, like when you see a cartoon walking, and you're like, fun, a cartoon walking. Something nice, relaxed. I would not say that this is a person. I would definitely say that this is, to me, more like a cartoon. I definitely picture the cartoon from Beauty and the Beast, the one that is a clock, the one that is fat that has a clock in the belly. It's like walking because it is not too fast, then it is definitely not a fast character. It definitely needs to take some time between the steps. That is why I feel it is almost funny.\",\n        \"That's a rough sensation. That's quite hectic and gives me a warning or something. It's like a signal. If my cell phone did this sensation, I would freak out. I guess because I did something wrong, like a warning. I feel like a rough sensation, no experience on my finger. It's shaking. It's like a strobe light in the club, which actually doesn't give me the feeling of freaking out. It's more like a rhythmic light show.\",\n        \"This feels like tiny electrocutions in my finger. I have been punished. I don't know. It's, but It makes me feel energetic, I think, like getting ready to pump. Yes, if you've ever touched an electrical fence, this is just tiny, tiny bits of it and only going through your finger. Friction, small pulses.\",\n        \"It feels like the glass is evened out a bit. It feels more flat, like the surface is even. The friction is not as hard to get through. It's not as heavy. It doesn't feel as heavy. Yes, no more bumps. It reminds me of having one of those days where everything just goes smoothly, like almost such a productive day. Usually, I have this feeling on Mondays as I've had like a well-rested weekend, and you just blast through today, and by the evening, you're just like, you went through all this stuff, and it didn't even feel that hard. It just went smoothly by.\",\n        \"I don't see any bumps particularly, but it feels like it makes the whole surface, also with all four fingers, a little stickier and not as smooth, more textured and a little bit rougher maybe. My fingers are starting to not slide but just keep on getting stuck a little bit. I feel like I could hold on to this. Here it feels like getting a little bit stuck because you move, but it can't really move forward smoothly. This feels like I actually cling on to a piece of glass and climb up just by holding on to the glass because it feels like it is very, very sticky. Maybe not sticky in this way, but I could grab it really well. If this was an object, I could really hold it in my hands firmly, and it wouldn't slip out of my hand.\"],\n       [\"I am not feeling a whole lot from this one if anything. Maybe if I slow it down. Yes, this one's nice and slow. I don't feel this one as strong as I feel a lot of the other ones. I don't know. A little bit more bored than the other ones. I think that's the tempo of it, maybe. And the fact that it is not an aggressive pulse to me. No, I don't feel distressed, really. Maybe bored is a good word. It's not bored in the sense that it's unpleasant, but it's just a bit more --. I don't know. I know I have been talking about printers, but maybe a personal printer from the early 2000s. It would take four minutes to print a sheet. I mean you have to be there for really quite a long time, and it is a little boring. I don't know. Nothing more direct. It doesn't feel like you're seeing an alarm or hearing an alarm or like whatever. It's more just like background noise or a background sensation. I don't know. I think it's funny. I'm equating all of these noises. But I think that's how it feels.\",\n        \"I would describe this to someone else as more discreet. I think you almost have to be attentive to realize it's there. And then it's suddenly more periodical, I guess. It doesn't feel like much on my finger. It's like a small buzz, but it doesn't feel like an obstruction in the same way that the other ones did. It makes me think of when you pull a sticker off something, and there is a tiny bit of glue left, still, even though you got rid of most of it. You wrap your hand across it, and you stick. It's just a little bit annoying.\",\n        \"Yes, it feels very periodic. It wants to tell me something. It feels like an alert of something like a very small alarm clock. The sensation is also electrical or a bit pointy but very periodic. So it feels like an alarm clock. The sound that I get in my head is an alarm clock going off in the morning telling me to wake up. Yes, I feel like it tells me to be alert or to be aware of something. It's more like danger ahead or something. It feels like it's telling me to stop doing something. I should put my attention towards something important.\",\n        \"This is a very obvious pulsing rhythm, which makes me think of an alarm like the alarms that were in Metal Gear Solid, like a factory-wide alarm by some security system over a big industrial plant. I wouldn't say it's aggressive like that, but it has that length and that dispersion, which makes me think of that, but it's milder. Insistent. Ebbing. Broad. Spacious. It's telling me to take note of something. It's something I should pay attention to, but nothing that's necessarily dangerous or alarming, but of importance to the sense of a better foreboding maybe.\",\n        \"Okay. This has a beat. This has a tempo. Maybe quite vigilant because it feels like an alarm because it's at a steady tempo. So I guess it's someone I would characterize him as being quite organized maybe but also quite fear-mongering. Alert. Aware. Awake.\",\n        \"It doesn't really feel like much. It just feels like I'm touching a computer screen or something. It's not just the pure glass. It feels a little bit more tactile but not as bad as the perspex-like feeling of the last one when you're running over. Yes, it does remind me of just feeling a phone or something. It's got the same sort of sensation, or at least like a touch screen laptop.\",\n        \"Okay, this one, I don't know if resistance is the proper word, but I feel like there's a little bit more resistance which is funny, but I don't know how it would look on the graph, but I feel like there's less of a peak. It's much more stable. I don't know. If it would have been an object, it's more like. I don't know, a slighter one. There's a slighter difference to someone else. Okay, I got my finger on the glass plate. I think because it does have some stops, but then it's just like someone just briefly brushes against your finger. But it is it's something that's not soft, but it's also it's not very unpleasant. I think it's awesome. Because of this sea sound, I'm feeling pretty peaceful. Yes, it's not bad because it's also pretty constant. It's repetitive. It's just like calming, maybe. Maybe that's the best emotion. I'm trying to think. I should know this more about what I touch. I try to think of something. No, because I was just trying to --. You know, when people take off their hard skin? And then one of those things, but then very, very slight, like very soft version, I think, from time to time, because of course, I feel like there's a pause in there. It's very soft. You're not going to take off any skin, but it's a bit of resistance.\",\n        \"I feel this one is so small. I feel this one with fewer intensity. It makes me feel like if I were almost observing something. It is so small that it reminds me of really maybe not focusing but of observing something that is tiny and small. I would describe this maybe as the flying of a mosquito or a little insect. It is like coming next to you, and then it stays there, and then it continues flying. But it's the sound of something that is so small. Yes, it reminds me of something that is small.\",\n        \"This is a very subtle sensation. I can barely feel it. They're little electric shocks but really gentle. It's like hiking and having an electric fence and trying out if there's electricity on it. It's really subtle, but it gives you little shocks. It's very shy, not asking much from others but still alive. It makes me feel that little things count as well. Big sensations are crazy and easy to feel, but this is like I can feel stuff like this on my finger. That's good to know. I can sense that it feels like those electric shocks, as I explained them go a little further than my skin. It goes to my first joint in my finger, so it's a deeper but really gentle feeling on my finger.\",\n        \"This one seems very subtle. Yes, I feel content. I think it feels like when you get a hot tub, a Jacuzzi, or something, and then you have the lowest of the lowest setting, like tiny bubbles. It's very subtle. It's very subtle to me, at least.\",\n        \"It feels even more heavy than the one before. It really feels like it's less smooth. Usually, there's some type of coating that makes it very smooth when you use touch displays. This is the opposite of that. It's very sturdy almost. It feels like something's trying to hold me back. A day where you're so tired that everything just feels more heavy and takes more focus.\",\n        \"This one even more. It feels even more textured. It feels like my fingers are wet again but not slippery, more like some kind of glue on it. It feels like it's very easy to hold on to, like you could spider-walk up a glass front with that. Not so easy. It doesn't make me feel that easy. It feels more like I'm stuck in something. Again, not stuck in something, but I can grab this one especially well. It tells me that this object that I'm touching is made for being held. That you don't lose the grab of it. You can always hold on to it. That's what it's made for. Now I see that the last one was very intense. Now I can feel it.\"],\n       [\"I feel like this reminds me of something, but I can't think what it is. It feels a little bit like before, like rubbing a balloon but on a lesser scale. It feels familiar, but I can't put my finger on exactly what is. I think it feels tiring, I would say.\",\n        \"This one is a very mechanical vibration, like a machine that's running. Yes, this is how it would feel to maybe touch my computer when it's on the actual PC computer. I can feel it rumbling on the inside, but it doesn't feel like there's something on the surface so much. It just feels like it's rumbling from within. I guess it kind of tingles. It kind of tingles on my finger, yes. It's not super rumbly. It's just like a little tingle of something running underneath. I don't know. I feel like it would be something that would be warm because it feels like a machine. But I can imagine if something randomly started making this, I would be concerned if it wasn't what I was expecting. I wasn't expecting it to be a running machine, I guess.\",\n        \"Yes, this one is really disruptive, again, because there are these longer intervals of just nothing. So it feels like I can do whatever I want, and then something just kind of grabs a finger. So it feels very restrictive and not in a good way. I mean, restrictive is not in a good way. It's annoying, oppressing. So it holds you back. It doesn't slide your finger. You expect a very smooth slide, but it disrupts that. I could imagine it would be used for something that tries to slow you down. Yes, because it gives this phase-like feel. I can imagine you're hurrying somewhere. And then somebody is like, no, don't go. It pulls you back from your clothes or something.\",\n        \"I can't really figure out what's going on with this one. There's something, and then it stops. Okay, there's a pattern. It's like a steady beat, and then it stops and then starts again, which is a bit irritating because I can feel like I'm getting into the pattern, and then it stops, and then I've lost the sensation, and then it starts again. Irritated. I'm anticipating something, and then I don't get it. Yes, it's a bit drawn out. I don't know if you can say all this. It is a setting on the vibrator that is really irritating because it makes you climax, and then it stops. Yes. Not consistent. But it is, but it's not. I don't know.\",\n        \"I would say this one here is more coarse, especially in relation to the other one. It sort of feels like the vibration pattern is more spread out than the other one was. Again, I would say I like this coarse feeling. But what I think where you could really harness the strength of this feeling would maybe be in combination with something like the one previous to this one. You could, instead of having this coarse vibration pattern, then have something that moves from coarse to more fine-grained over time interval to communicate change more or less. If I had to put an adjective on this one here, I would say static. Not in a bad way, but it's just a static feeling of some coarse vibration pattern.\",\n        \"Nothing on my first finger. Nothing on second. Nothing on third. Okay, definitely getting something super light. Feels like there's big gaps between it. Only when I change direction, maybe it does something. Feels super light. This feels like a very chilled-out one. Like you're taking a stroll on the beach. I don't know what vibrates on a beach. Your phone vibrates in your pocket or something like relax; we're having a good time.  Somebody that is a bit of a stoner and is giving deep thoughts for some reason. I don't know why. But it just feels like a chill-out, like whatever, we're just hanging out. Just chilled out, having a good time.\",\n        \"Okay, I feel like I don't feel anything so very, very slightly. Yes, it seems very light. Yes, I can barely feel anything. Yes, it's almost like I'm feeling only the glass.\",\n        \"This is like quick, very subtle sensations, where the friction is increasing. It's tingling on the tip of my finger, but I feel it very subtly, like tingly.  It's pretty calming. Maybe it just feels like swiping on your phone, and then you get, like a heads up, a notification, or anything. Yes, it's kind of like you have to be aware of something, but it's not uncomfortable.\",\n        \"This one's a bit more intense, a bit faster. It feels more like shaving even though they may be all should have felt like that. This one feels more like shaving. It's also trying to stop my movements. It's a bit angry. It's like the shaving sound, but higher pitched because it's it feels faster than that. It feels a bit annoyed, a bit angry like it's teasing someone. I sense four fast beats and then a short break. Each of the beats is very fast, high-frequency.\",\n        \"Yes, this one is more like the first one. It's more going. It's more constant. It's also funny because sometimes when you move your finger back and forth, it's only on the one side because there are those intervals where there isn't that much friction, and it's always on the one side. Like the glass is vibrating a little bit in some places. Yes, I mean, I shouldn't, I guess. Sometimes it feels like when you move your finger back and forth. It feels like there's always the sensation at the same part, and then on the other side, there's not that much sensation. I guess that's more because I've moved my finger in that certain way. It's a little like you can control what you're doing or what the plate is doing, what the glass is doing. These incy-wincy vibrations it's funny.\",\n        \"I don't know. Knocking on the door. Something's happening. Something is about to happen. Decisive. Four knocks, and then it stops, and then four knocks, and it stocks. Four knocks, and it goes on.\",\n        \"This one's also very gentle. It kind of reminds me of walking through sand like fine sand, and you can feel it filtering through your feet. Daydreaming. Pensive. Inquisitive. Carefree. It feels very rounded, very soft as well. It reminds me of being alone on a beach by myself that you just whimsically decided to do.\"],\n       [\"This makes me feel like I'm in Ved Siden Af. Literally, the first thing that came to my mind was being in a nightclub. It's quite frantic, intense, a little bit scary. It feels like a bomb that is going to explode or something. It feels really strong on my finger. Yes, it feels like when your skin is pulsing, maybe a bit sore or something.\",\n        \"Okay. It feels a little static, like when you rub a balloon on your head, and then you put it against the --. Yes, exactly when you rub a balloon on your head, and you put it on the wall. That exact kind of static is what I feel. Yes, it's prickly, but not in a sharp way. I feel a lot of small like [onomatopoeia] as if there was a bunch of bamboo woods sticking out, little ones. I was just putting my finger around it. Yes, like tiny little things that I slightly catch on, but not really on my finger slightly catches on to.\",\n        \"Yes, okay. This one feels like you're running, and you stumble upon all the hills in your way. I think there's something that stops the movement, like intervals. At least it feels like it. It looks like an application is lagging. So it's not nice. It makes you pissed off. Irritating. It's probably someone very neurotic or prompt or impulsive behavior. I don't know. I guess exactly like computer lag. It makes you impatient. Come on, do something properly now.\",\n        \"So it feels like very steady, little beats, almost like playing ping pong with a tiny little ball. But it feels like a bit of a delay kind of beat, like it doesn't feel like it's a very fast tempo matching like any speed I'm at. It's just like a slow, drawn-out little beat. I think it makes me feel energetic because it's a bit jumpy, bouncy. And it's a very exciting, positive kind of beat. Playing ping pong. I don't know why. It feels good because it's not a constant kind of vibration. It's up and down, up and down, so it makes me feel a bit more engaged with the glass and the screen.\",\n        \"I would say maybe just to describe what I'm feeling also. This feels like longer bursts of vibrations. And to me, what it sort of signifies is, I don't know, something that's activated or something that's ongoing or in live progress. That's what it's telling me. I would characterize it as someone who is, I wouldn't say, hard-working, necessarily, but someone who is sticking to their guns and doing what they're told. They will get up every morning and do their thing and do what they're supposed to do.\",\n        \"On this finger, I can feel tiny little, very light bumps, but super, super light. Not bringing up many feelings, more annoyance that I can't feel it, but I think I've got quite calloused fingers. It's weird that I can't feel it on those two. Feels like a stubbly beard, but like the day after shaving.\",\n        \"Okay, this is very, I don't know, subtle. I think of drawing dotted lines for some reason. I don't know. It just reminds me of this game that you play where you have to keep slicing things into half. It just reminds me of the dotted line from the game. Yes, slicing and breaking things down. It's like a starting and stopping sort of sensation. I don't know like I'm in a car that I'm trying to learn, but I'm starting and stopping and that sort of memory.\",\n        \"It just feels like an uneven surface. Like something is scratching. It kind of reminds me of when people have uneven walls, and there's stuff in it, and you go over with your fingers, and it's uncomfortable. It kind of gives me goosebumps. Yes, an uncomfortable feeling. You want to take your hand off.\",\n        \"This feels like many short sensations, kind of like small fireworks, jumping jack, I think they're called. It's telling me that something is going on somewhere, but it's a bit too light for it to be nearby. It makes me feel interested. It's catching my curiosity. It feels very light on my finger. It feels dampened like it could be louder, but it's not coming through.\",\n        \"Yes, those are very little, very small ones. It's like those very small snow thingies. I don't know why I associate nails with that. She's - why is she a she - very alive. She wants to do something. She's very squirrelly. She wants to move. She can't sit still. Somebody with ADHD or something. That one is more like it makes me feel alive. Yes, it's more natural, and it's more what life feels like. It's awake, and it's there. You can sense those little. I'll call them electrical shocks. They're very intense, and you can feel those in your finger. And then in between, there's just normal friction of the glass. It's telling me to do something, to move. I feel like I moved my finger more than on the ones before, too. It's a little like popcorn, maybe.\",\n        \"This is like ice is breaking or the glass plate is breaking. Danger. Be aware of something. Not good. A person who was in danger or is dangerous. I can't tell. Going ice skating, I think, but not in a safe place but on a lake in the country. That's not an action. I don't know.\",\n        \"This makes me want to dance. It feels on a dance floor. I don't know. Some kind of high higher intensity music. Yes, you're boogieing. It makes me feel macho, charismatic, what's the other one, influential. It reminds me of going to a club in Copenhagen where I didn't know anybody and I was with some friends, and I was drunk and just didn't care, tore up the dance floor and slapped it. It feels very exciting, like high energy. It feels almost like buttons, a little bit, like the way an old school telephone's buttons would feel like, just something that you can explore touch-wise.\"],\n       [\"Again, this one feels quite similar to the ones before. It makes me feel quite agitated because it's smooth, and then you can feel stronger vibrations, I think, but you don't know when they're coming. It actually feels a little bit like chalk on a blackboard kind of thing. I would say it's unpredictable. Yes, I would say it makes me feel a little bit nervous. No, it doesn't remind me of anything I felt before.\",\n        \"I can only feel it sometimes. So I'm trying to figure out what it is based on. Sometimes my finger feels it. Yes, it's relatively smooth. Yes, I guess it would feel sort of like this table, like an IKEA desk table, I think. It feels like there's a slight amount of friction. Sometimes I feel more than other times. I'm not sure if that's just me pressing too hard. I guess it's neutral. I mean, I'm not entirely certain because sometimes I feel something, but for the most part, it feels fresh and clean relative to the other feelings, but not as much as glass would feel.\",\n        \"This one, I guess, is some of the sticky ones. It actually doesn't feel as restricting as the one that was more or had a pattern. It's because I guess it takes you by surprise, and then it gives you this false idea that everything is nice, and then it suddenly has this [onomatopoeia] that stops your finger. It doesn't feel good. So it's a bit startling. It makes you feel tricked because, as I said, it gives a good feeling everything works. Then suddenly, it's sticky. It reminds you of boundaries, but I know it's in my head, so if I were playing with a box or something physical. When this disruption happens, it feels like I'm hitting something physical with my finger. So maybe even though I know, it happens at random places, but since I'm drawing actual shapes with my finger right now and this tends to happen at certain points. It maybe gives this 3-D imagery.\",\n        \"That's weird. It's almost really impossible to tell if --. It's almost like running your finger along something, and it is getting caught like a very rough surface. It makes me feel like it's more the surface rather than the vibration. I think it's telling me something's broken. I don't know. I'm really struggling to figure out the pattern in this. It feels like it's almost like when there is the vibration or feeling, it shouldn't be there. This is kind of strange and peculiar. I think it's maybe when you are daydreaming, and you're just doing things mindlessly. It's the kind of feeling where you get lost in that sensation of your finger to the glass. And then you get that vibration. And then you're like, I'm not focusing. I'm not concentrating and then maybe confused.\",\n        \"This one here is a little harder to distinguish, but I got it. So I would say with this one, here again, it has a high attack and a quick decay. There's a lot of spatial separation between the oscillations, and I would say, maybe even to the extent that I would have a hard time naturally distinguishing this as something that I would pay attention to. I guess, just intuitively, I would be in doubt as to whether this is just something that happens to me by chance or if this is actually something that is directed towards me. I would say somebody who is a little scattered in their life. Things are maybe not so much under control, and they might be living in bursts and then just completely, I don't know, disappear and go away for some time, and then they just come back full force.\",\n        \"What's wrong with my fingers? Again, absolutely nothing that time. No.\",\n        \"Yes, this feels like slight resistance, sort of a thing. So it feels like there's something that's moving against the direction that I'm going in. Yes, it also is like underneath it, like the sandworms in Dune. You can feel them going against the direction that you're going in. Yes, I feel like I'm touching like ridges soft, like animals tack or something like that like scales and things like that. I don't know. It's someone who's very rebellious against the establishment sort of thing. I feel very tired after fighting so long with somebody is something that I would attach to this. I don't know, like keep moving on.\",\n        \"This feels like a glass with riddles in it or something that you can cut yourself on. It's also a little bit uncomfortable because it feels like your finger is kind of stuck. Like a small hole in the glass that your finger gets stuck in, and then it takes a little longer to get past it. It kind of feels like it has sharp edges. Yes, a broken phone glass, like when you've broken your glass on your cell phone, would be what I would attach it to. I can only feel it sometimes, not all the time.\",\n        \"This one's a bit happier, like small bunnies jumping. It's more like summertime. It's very light but again with the beating like a heart. It feels like it wants to tell me something. It feels kind of light, just knocking on my finger but a very light knock not with any intentions to hurt or be angry but to tell something. It makes me feel happier. It feels more like summertime. Like it's not cold outside. It feels more like laying on the beach and watching the sun and then feeling your own heart at the same time.\",\n        \"The intervals are longer in between them. It's like one of those book covers that have different surfaces, and when you go over the book cover at some point, your finger will be a little slower because there's another surface that you go over. Yes, it's like the book cover. If there's a little glue or something left on a table that you go over and you like stuck for a second. It doesn't feel like an electrical thing anymore. It feels like something I know, and that's why I can put it somewhere. It feels like something real. This is so weird. I don't think there are special feelings associated with that. It's nothing I would say that is, in particular, happy or sad about this. It's like normal. It happens.\",\n        \"This is a heartbeat. This is very real. This is not nice. This is too real. Oh my god. This is not very nice. Oh my god. It's too real. I'm fingering a dead guy. I don't know. I'm alive in some sort of fucked up way. I can feel my own heart. I can grab my own heart and feel it. Yes, just very real. It almost feels not continuous, more like real heartbeats. It's not mechanical. It's very biological in some way.\",\n        \"This one reminds me of a heartbeat. As for the touch, it feels like I'm being shocked with electricity. It's very abrupt but also resting. It kind of reminds me of when you get really scared, and you can feel your heartbeat in your body and your face and your lungs. That's kind of how it feels. It feels like my finger is touching wood like fresh-cut wood, and there are these little patches of abrasion, and you hit these little patches with your finger. I feel like a big event just happened. And the event was adrenaline in a bad way, like you are in a parasympathetic state or aroused in the sense that you're alert.\"],\n       [\"No, but I think that is largely because it's quite weak, rather than the pattern itself. No, not yet. It's quite calming, really. Honestly, because of the white noise, it kind of sounds like a beach, and that's the only thing I can have in my head. I don't really know. It's maybe pulsating. I don't know. Again, it's not massively put me up or down, to be honest. I think if it was a stronger pulse, then maybe. No, but again, I think that's partially more to do with the actual fact that I am here with a friend with white noise. It's not a very distressing situation. Quite pleasant, really. I don't know.\",\n        \"It makes me feel a bit annoyed, actually. And it makes me feel like I'm more sweaty than I think I am. I'm sticking. Slightly irritating. The sensation feels like my finger is wet. I think this is the best way to describe it. It reminds me of running my fingers on the window of a car that's slightly damp, like a mirror, a damp mirror. It's like you're trying to do or describe it as like you're trying to do something, but you can't. It's sticky, but not sticky. That's really bad, sorry.\",\n        \"I don't know. Ice cream, I think, is the first thing that comes to my mind. I think it's a bit soft. I want to say comforting, but it's not really comforting. It might feel more like a touch. Right now, I feel it a bit more like pointy. It comes more in waves or in small outbursts. Jumpy and a bit pushy. Yes, my finger jumping like it's going, and then it's stopping and going and stopping in a way. I would say I think the adjective is jumpy or barrier or something like that.\",\n        \"This one was harder to understand. There's a sweatiness and slight pulsing. It feels like a really big ragtag ball rolling over yourself. And it doesn't seem to be that much consistency. It feels many-sided. I thought of some sort of rolling animal, and I was thinking of it. I forgot what cartoon it was, but there is this ant-eater-type looking thing with a long snout, which would roll itself in and roll around spaces. But generally big, fat, with lots of strange angles and subsections.\",\n        \"Not anything in particular. Maybe uneasy because my finger isn't that smoothly gliding. So it's unpredictable, maybe. Yes, it's more an alarming thing. I guess if this was to be on some sort of computer, maybe it would be telling me not to do something or that something wasn't available to me. Like this thing that you're trying to do can't be accessed.\",\n        \"I don't know. I also can't feel as much of this one. I can't work out whether it's just doing the same pattern that's making it harder to run your hand from side to side or whether it's actually what it is supposed to be doing. It feels like there's a lot more vibrations and stuff coming from this one. It's a little bit like my phone is in my pocket, and it's vibrating a little bit.\",\n        \"I feel like this is similar to the ones I just had. It's much more intense, the intervals, I think, when it comes back. Someone who's just like tapping on the glass or something, and they want to tell you something. It's much more urgent, just like I have a message to tell you. I think if you think about an iPhone or something and then we just put this in your iPhone screen, this is like your mom is calling, obviously. It's very invasive, I think. I'm like, okay, I need to pay attention to something because something or someone is trying to tell me something. I'm more alert. I think there's something I should pay attention to. And this is reminding me just like a trigger or warning or alert. Very, very present. Sort of be like, okay, now maybe it's time for you to shut up. Yes, no, I think so. Doesn't sound nice.\",\n        \"I would say that this one is almost like a drumbeat. It's like if you put your hand in a drum and someone is like kicking at the drums, and then you have your hand there. That is the thing that I'm feeling in the tip of my finger. This one, I would say, is more almost like a musical thing. These ones that go a little bit faster, all of them, make me feel more musical. This one specifically is almost like the beat of a drum, like if it was like a drummer having some rhythm. If this rhythm was a person, I would say it is definitely like the drummer of the band, the drum player of the band, and just like staying there in the background being chill, playing the same rhythm.\",\n        \"That's an interesting feeling, actually, because it's super fractured. Some impulses are a little bit stronger than others. It's like being out of breath after running a lot, and my heart is beating fast, so exhausted.\",\n        \"I don't know. It seemed like when, it's a weird thing, but if you have ever been together with --. If you have a friend that's a bit slow in his head, this is what it feels like. It's a bit behind. Yes, maybe some high-powered training like cycling, swimming. You want to push yourself, actually, when you hear this, feel this, I mean.\",\n        \"This one is hard. I can sense the friction, as I've talked about before but also sometimes I can feel like small vibrating sensations. It's tough to differentiate from the other one. It feels a lot like the one before.\",\n        \"This one feels very mellow. This one also feels like it has bumps in it. An underlying texture then some bumps that go on every couple centimeters. Yes, this could be a scrolling-down like something on social media where you have long posts, and every few centimeters you scroll, there is a new one with a big bump. Telling you that there's a big bump. Nice, it feels good. It feels like you're scrolling through a lot of content, maybe. Someone who's online a lot. I don't know why but this one really feels like it could be scrolling through social media on the phone. So I'd say the person is also very social media involved. Or like a forum or something like a forum where you have different articles that you scroll through.\"],\n       [\"I'm not feeling a whole lot from this one, to be honest. There's one of the other ones that I said that for. It feels similar. It's like there's something, but I am just not quite getting it.\",\n        \"This makes me think of a motor, a tiny little motor. It's slightly buzzing but more powerful. It's just like a buzz. It's like I would imagine a bee would feel like if it just sat on my finger buzzing. Excitement, maybe, is an emotion in a cutesy way. I don't think I feel satisfied. I feel like this would be before the satisfaction. This doesn't feel dominant to me. It feels like a little dog that's barking, and it thinks it's really dangerous, but it's actually really cute. It can feel like that.\",\n        \"The first thing I was thinking was an electrical saw, not a saw machine, but the round ones, a round saw spinning around. And then I get this pulsating. It's almost like a heartbeat or something like that or like a pulse you can feel on someone. I would say it's electrical. And then there are these small shocks. Yes, there are these things that bring attention to themselves. I don't know what they're trying to tell me. It feels like communication, but I don't know what it wants to communicate.\",\n        \"Tanker. Is this the same one? Again, it feels very similar to just having very sweaty fingers on a pane of glass. It's hard to notice anything very specific about whether there is a current. Now. That's interesting. That makes me think furry. It makes me think I'm handling a hamster. Small and furry. And it's very mild-tempered, curled up in itself. And it's vibrating in an anxious but charming manner. Coziness. Warmth. Sanctuary. Safety.\",\n        \"This one is a bit rougher, like dragging my hand through sandpaper. Yes, it's like with the other one where if I were to use this on some sort of software, it would be telling me not to do something. Posh. Abrasive. Black and white.\",\n        \"It's a little bit odd. It's as if there's something on the surface, but I can't feel it. And almost like when you run your hands on a really thin piece of carpet, a carpet that's got lots of stuff in it, not a big, fluffy one, but a boring carpet they put in hospitals and stuff. That's a really hard question. It feels bumpy. It feels like there's something in between. Because it's got this carpet sensation. It feels like it's going to be a bit more static. It's going to be harder to run your fingers across, but it's not. It just feels like there's something in between the glass.\",\n        \"Just trying to think if I can relate it to something. I feel like it's like I'm touching something with like a ridge on it. A person with rough edges or something. That would make the most sense. Yes, so that's not necessarily bad or negative things, more like, maybe the person has issues or no clue. It feels a bit weird because I would not know what object to picture linked to this thing because it's a very big difference in what I'm touching. I think I'm quite okay with like --. Some of the others I wanted them to stop. I'm quite okay with feeling this one, so I feel quite good. I'm more intrigued. I think with this one, I'm like, I want to know now what the thing could be or what person this person is. No, so it's quite pleasant. It's not too alien in a way. But it's also a bit confusing because I can't relate it to an object quickly at the top of my mind.\",\n        \"This reminds me of a ball bouncing, but it's a big ball. It's like if you were jumping, but each jump takes you a lot of time, just like if you pass a lot of time like almost doing a squat and then jumping back again to the top because the pulses are --. I would say that it's intense, but then it doesn't go that fast. If this was a wave, I would describe it as a wave with normal frequency but a bigger amplitude. I definitely feel the sensation for a longer time, but it's also not super frequent. It reminds me of a big object trying to jump. I can feel like a big bump, and then it disappears but quite fast, and then the glass becomes rough, and then I feel it again. It's like a pulse, but the pulse is slower. I would say that this pulse makes me feel almost a little bit boring, like it is less interesting than the other ones. Yes, it's less interesting than the ones that go faster or the ones that are more intense.\",\n        \"That's like being on a ship which is going down, and there's this evacuation sound and red lights turning on and off. Everyone is freaking out and trying to rescue themselves. Anxious because it's quite clearly a warning. It's a rhythmic pattern which fades out. It's actually like a red light which does circles, and you see the light, and then it turns off, and you see the light, and then it turns off.\",\n        \"Yes, this one is a bit more coarse. It feels more heavy on my finger. I don't know how to describe that. It's hard to associate it with a feeling. I have to say. It almost feels like a pulse, actually, now that I think about it, like a heartbeat. Yes, it feels more heavy than the last one.\",\n        \"It feels kind of distant. It makes you feel a bit sad almost. There's longer between the ups and downs. It reminds me of missing someone or being away. When I move my finger down, it goes up and down these small slopes. Or like pulses.\",\n        \"Okay, this is also like small vibrations, like not a lot of vibrations but each of them is much more pronounced. I really know that I have a bigger texture than I'm feeling. It tells me that I have a rougher texture that I am gliding over. Yes, maybe of a wall texture, maybe, like a very small textured wall. Yes, maybe just touching and feeling a concrete wall, maybe. I can't really put any emotion on this one.\"],\n       [\"I don't really like this one. It feels a bit scratchy. It feels like rubber, like putting on rubber boots or wearing something rubbery, touching something rubbery. It makes me feel uncomfortable, I would say. No, I don't feel excited. I feel slightly distressed. I don't feel satisfied.\",\n        \"Okay. This again feels dirty, like not super sticky. I don't know. It sort of feels like my finger is getting dragged by something. I don't like it. I feel like some kind of friction. This one sort of feels like it's pushing me a little bit. The other one sort of felt like I was touching a kid's iPad that had spilled juice on it. This sort of feels a little bit like it's pushing back at me, and I don't know why. Okay, it feels like there's a bunch of stuff on it, and when you pass your finger by it, it's blowing at you. I don't know.\",\n        \"If I was talking about something sticky before, then this one feels even more. I was thinking for a second that there was something on my finger. Yes, it looks like I've taken jam, poured it on my counter, and now I'm just playing around with it. Yes, this is not a good feeling at all. Yes. Sticky. Glimmered. I think it's even oppressive. I can't move my finger properly. It's literally stopping it. It's not actually stopping, but it really feels like you just put something sticky here right now and there on the glass. It's telling me I should clean the glass. I don't know. If this was like an application of the touchscreen, and I would feel this, I would probably make a restart. It obviously signifies that something is not correct.\",\n        \"I don't really like this feeling. It's a bit haphazard. It's almost like a siren, but it's really soft. It's almost like a warning kind of feeling for some reason. I don't know why, but it makes me feel like there's danger coming. It's ominous but not something I can say I felt before, maybe just like feelings I am getting from watching movies and being in a barrack or something. I feel it could be this [onomatopoeia]. Footsteps are coming. Ominous. Suspenseful. Thrilling. Danger is encroaching. Haphazardous. Slippery. It's gripping and then slipping. I think that's why it's making me feel a bit uncomfortable.\",\n        \"This one here feels a bit harsher. I would say it's more warning. If I were to compare this to another modality like sound, for instance, I would say, if you do something on the computer and you are unsuccessful in your action, you will get a sound or something that kind of communicates something went wrong instead of some, I don't know, rising pitch sound. This is more like something didn't go as you would have expected it to go. I don't know. Unsuccessfulness. Try again feeling, if that makes any sense.\",\n        \"Maybe something on the first two. Yes, there's my pinky picking something up. Definitely got something. I don't like this one. Why? It feels uneven. The vibrations just aren't equal to each other, and that just doesn't feel good. It's more intense than the others, but not in a nice way. Nothing springing to mind. I'm not having a good time, I would say. Bad. I'm not sad. I'm not angry. What's a bad emotion? Annoyance; get yourself together. Why are you so on even? Yes, someone who is sloppy, messy. I'm annoyed at you. And you're making me uncomfortable.\",\n        \"This feels like a build-up to something like at a song when the bass drops and then you're building down to the base drop, or you're building up to the peak. I don't know what it's telling me. I think it's just like chug along, get ready, sort of like preparation stage, I would say. I think it's like someone's digging on my skin. I'd say that's pretty much it. It's nice and rhythmic. Yes, maybe when I'm falling asleep. It's sort of repetitive patterns that make you want to fall asleep like a hard worker. I would definitely say this is someone who works very hard every day might not be the smartest person, but it's definitely the hard-working person in the room.\",\n        \"It feels like I'm getting electrocuted, like I'm touching a light ball or something with electricity in. It's summing on my finger sometimes, but not all the time. It's quick sensations whenever I drag my finger. I should take my finger off the plate. It makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable, I guess, because it's not that nice to feel like you're getting electrocuted. Yes, like touching a light bulb or something like electricity of some sort. Also, like the thing they have, the round thing where you touch it and then it electrocutes you when you take your finger off. Someone you should keep away from. Like quick lightning sounds, I think.\",\n        \"This one feels like it's moving along too quickly for its own good. It feels like there should be a constant beat, but there isn't, really. It's a bit chaotic. It feels like someone's running and falling all the time, falling over themselves. It feels a bit in a hurry to get somewhere. It feels like somebody is being chased. Just like when you're working out, and you can't really do anymore, but you have to keep going. If this was my heart, it's telling me to stop and take a break. It feels stressful. It feels a bit scared.\",\n        \"This has a pattern again. It's pretty loud noises. It's a very, very intense one, not as quiet as the last ones, but pretty loud and also pretty frequent. That one's very demanding. It's not like something I felt before but maybe like something I've heard before because this one has the same frequency as an alarm clock might have. I don't think I felt it before, though. It's a very weird thing. While you move over the glass, you can feel those very big and intense sensations, just very big, intense vibrations in there. It's an exciting emotion. It's excited. Something's happening. Something's happening. You can anticipate that something will happen now. That's kind of what it tells you, I guess.\",\n        \"This is like a fast heartbeat. It's not very nice. It's disturbed in some way. [onomatopoeia]. It's not that good. It's stressful. The plate is stressed, or someone is stressed. It's difficult to save with actions, maybe like doing something where you're on edge. You have to perform in some way. You have to pitch something. You have to go to an exam. Yes, it reminds me of exam situations. It's a stressful sound.\",\n        \"This reminds me of when I got a lot of gas, and I got a fart, and you're really trying to not let it out all at once, but it just comes in little spurts, little sputters. Gassy. Obnoxious. Unwanted. It makes me feel like I should be careful because you never know. It makes me feel kind of paranoid but not really, kind of anxious.

This one feels like an alarm, or something bad is happening, but they want to keep everyone calm. I mean, it feels like a phone ringing, actually. That's what it feels like. It feels not unpleasant. It's quite a nice intensity. Some of the other ones were a bit more like you're struggling to feel it, or else it was very in your face. This one's more pulsating, which is quite pleasant, but the rhythm of it is not nice or not, not nice, but it's quite jarring. But the actual sensation, the tactile sensation, is quite nice.\",\n        \"This feels super resistant to me. This feels quite forceful. This one is a little bit aggressive. Sporadically. No, I don't associate much with it. I don't think I really felt it before. This feels a bit like being stuck in the mud or something.\",\n        \"I would say it's periodic. It comes in waves. It feels like it's trying to stop me, but it doesn't feel like it's succeeding. It's saying stop, stop, stop, stop, but not really putting effort into it. So it's half-hearted messaging that it feels like. I don't really think I can put any adjectives to it. It feels like a fence. It's strong. It's emphatic. I'm sure that it's there, and it's insisting, but not in a way that succeeds with it. It's insisting, but also not really trying or not giving it all.\",\n        \"This one's very hard to distinguish. It's like my fingers are sweaty, but maybe there's more buzziness when I do it.

It's just tender. Tender. That's a good way to describe it. Tender. And just trivial and novel. It's not urgent. It's just kissing my fingers. It's not nudging it in a certain direction.

Almost a little bit tingling in my fingers, but other than that, it just feels like glass.

It's not rubbery but, therefore, so oh my god, dolphin skin happy. I don't know if anyone else said that. I think it's nice but also because of my past experience I'm like, it should be wet because a dolphin is in the water. So I'm like, what? It's a bit weird in a way. But also it's a bit confusing because it's only for a very short amount of time that you feel it. I think it's also a bit intriguing if I'm talking about emotions. I'm trying to feel it better, but it's not giving me enough time to properly feel it. So I can't tell for certain if it's a dolphin.\",\n        \"This one goes too slow.

But it is so slow. It is not even a warning is like something that to feel worried about, I would say. It's again the feeling that there's something rough like a pulse that is getting rougher and rougher. And that sensation reminds me of a lot of doctors that are looking at one of those screens that are showing the beats of the heart, and it's going super slow. A little bit more aroused, like stressed and alert. Yes, it definitely makes me feel more alert and almost a little bit cringy. It is so intense but also with so much spacing between the stimuli. It is not a happy emotion.\",\n        \"I can sense on my skin that there are breaks in between the sensation. The sensation is tingly again on my fingertips.

That's why I'm struggling with the sensation.\",\n        'Running or some kind of workout or something.',\n        \"This one is very hard to differentiate from the glass, almost like it's hiding from me, and I can't find it.\",\n        \"This feels even more sticky than before, really much textured, almost soft in a way, maybe, maybe even like velvet, a little bit like a velvet maybe. No, not really. It's like a medium buzzing but not low, not high, and more like a neutral buzzing sound. Yes, it feels like touching something. I can't really describe it.\"],\n       [\"I do not like this one. And it feels like sandpaper. And it feels quite frustrating. It feels like you want to wear it down to make it smooth, but then you can't. So it's quite annoying. It feels like I said, like sandpaper, just like holding a bit of paper or a bit of cardboard.\",\n        \"This sort of feels like glass, but the first thing that came to my mind was a shaver. I don't know why. Yes, it sort of feels like I'm shaving something, mowing something down. I feel like a shaver or electric toothbrush, but you don't normally feel that with your finger. It's just that sort of sensation that I get from it in terms of something that I have felt before with my finger. I don't know. I am still feeling glass, so it still feels relatively smooth. I don't know. I don't feel hairs, but I feel like I'm pushing something away, but I don't feel what it is.\",\n        \"This one feels like a machine that is pumping out something. So it has a steady purring or steady hum. And then there are sudden weird outbursts, but you can't really explain. Yes, it feels like I'm interrupting something. But it's a machine at work. I shouldn't be touching it. I don't feel like I'm doing anything with my finger here. So it feels like I'm interrupting some kind of process. It doesn't give me any kind of feeling of control at all. As I said, I don't know, a machine pumping out packages like in the Amazon workplace or something like that. They come out of the line. I don't know. This one is a strange one. It doesn't really seem to have any kind of consistency of movement. It doesn't feel like I know the rest of them. No matter how I move my finger, it also doesn't matter. But this one just feels completely off. The one I said there was more drawing at least gave an illusion that I'm doing something, but this one is nothing.\",\n        \"This is interesting because it's like a small, slight vibration, and then you got a big vibration. It reminds me of my vibrator, so I would say sexual. But maybe interesting because I'm sure there's a pattern to that big vibration, but it almost feels like it's not because you get lost between the small one. And then the big one. So exciting. It makes me want to keep putting my finger across the screen. Exciting. Interesting. Evoking.\",\n        \"Okay. I don't really seem to be feeling anything, a little bit, maybe. Let's go with it. I would describe it as maybe a vibrator, almost like it's as opposed to some of the other ones that have this very fast onset and very quick decay as well. This is more of just a quick, vibrating feeling. There's just a continuous vibration. A vibrator. It feels like it's ticklish. Now that I can feel it better, it feels like it travels up the arm. It's a nice sensation actually, very pleasant. It's telling me. I don't know. I don't know if it's telling me anything specifically. It just leaves me with this sensation of pleasantness. I don't really feel that it conveys any message as such other than a purely hedonistic feel of something that feels good. Whereas some of the other examples where I said like this could be a notification, something very sharp that grabs my attention or communicates something's going on. This is more just a static, nice feeling, I would say.\",\n        \"Okay, nothing there on the first finger. Nothing on second. So hard to tell the difference between the glass and the sensations. Yes, getting something on my pinky finger. This feels definitely more intense than the last one. Is it like a longer one and then a shorter one or something? Feels like that. Or is it just one? [onomatopoeia]. Yes, this one's okay. It feels like there's more manic. There's more beats in it. Do you know whenever you're playing Xbox or Playstation, and you crash into something, or somebody shoots you, it vibrates? Feels like that. It's telling me that I've just been shot or that I've crashed into something. I'm associating it with that memory.\",\n        \"Yes, this feels different. It's pulsing, but like, more slowly and with deeper impact. I can feel it a little stronger. I didn't know, sort of like superior and like a dragon or something. I don't know. I'm assuming this is what it feels like when you want to feel the vibrations of a motor or something like that. So I feel like I can feel the vibrations. No, not any particular emotion. I'm just feeling overwhelmed, maybe.\",\n        \"This feels like a sudden sensation, almost like there's a broken --. Something is broken on the glass or increased friction. It's not all the time. It's just some of the time. It feels like my finger is getting stuck when I feel it. It makes me want to lift my finger, like remove my finger from it. It feels like I might cut my finger on it or something and then lift my finger and then put it back on on the other side.\",\n        \"This one's a bit more sticky in a way. I feel like there's a sensation all the time, but there's a beating on top of that sensation. It's kind of holding on to me, a lot more friction all the time. And still, every time there's a beat, a more intense beat, there's kind of trying to hold me back. It's more persistent, a bit, don't want to say angry, but, yes, persistent. This person is not someone who's backing down. It's someone who gets what they want. It's kind of like pulling a car in the snow, and your tire is flat. So every time it goes around, then there is more of a hard hit.\",\n        \"They're pretty strong again, and there's no real pause in between them. I feel like even if there is a little pause in between them, it might still be just a little sensation instead of the big ones. It's maybe like if you get a lot of messages at the same time. Like if you get 50 pictures or something from a friend and then the phone is constantly vibrating, it's a little like that. It has those little pauses in between, and then it's just a lot of vibrations. This person would be very annoying, especially over a long time. Yes, definitely. It's a very not calm kind of thing. It's a stressful situation. Yes, I would associate stress with that. And it's just being all over the place like before an exam when you're kind of excited about what's happening but also a little scared.\",\n        \"A stop and go feeling like keep going stop, keep going, stop, keep going stop, keep going stop. It feels like I am in a very narrow maze. I need to very quickly stop and turn another way and then go and then turn the other way and go. It's like a stop, go, stop, go, stop, go. Nothing really, I guess, other than stop and go stop and go. I think that's why I'm doing this. I'm constantly changing my path in some way. Very commanding, directive, I guess, in some way, but also very undecisive in some other way. I'm not doing anything right. A relationship? No, that's a joke. I instantly thought of Google Maps like when you're trying to get somewhere. Stop and go. Stop and go. Turn.\",\n        \"This one is disruptive. I feel like you're painting or something, or you are writing, typing some continuous action. There's an interruption, but you keep going. Highly alert. Almost like caffeine. You've already drunk a cup or two of coffee, and you're hyper-aware. There's a smooth vibration followed by a sort of pulse. I don't know if the smooth vibration comes back immediately after the pulse or if there's a pause. But the smooth vibration is rigid, and the pulse is unexpected.\"],\n       [\"This one is a lot slower. This one feels almost like a heartbeat or something. Yes, it's a heart beating or maybe not a heart. Maybe if you had some sort of system where it was like --. This is so bizarre. It's like a watering system where you have sprinklers that go in regular patterns and put water on people's gardens. It feels a bit like that or something. Yes, it's regular and quite soft. The last one was a bit harsh. It's not soft because it doesn't feel fluffy or anything. It's soft in terms of I can feel the pulse, and it feels more, maybe, indirect. It's like someone else's alarm is going off.\",\n        \"So it feels a little bit stronger, more like a little zing on your finger. I am blanking on adjectives. I think I would also describe this as staccato, a fast staccato buzz on your finger. It's not very imaginative. I'm not really feeling any emotions.\",\n        \"There's not really anything that comes to my mind, actually. Maybe, I don't know, spitting. I think that's the first coherent thing that came into my mind. I get a picture of yellow or purple or something like that. I don't know. It feels like color. I don't know why. It reminds me of something, but I don't really know what it reminds me of. I have this unclear picture of some plastic looking like jigsaw puzzles with some colors on them. But I don't know what it is. Maybe a feeling of some playset when I was a kid. I think that's what's coming to my mind. I had this playset where you could have these infrared lights, and you could set up this alarm system. Somehow that reminds me of this, like playing with electrical things as a child.\",\n        \"This sounds really chirpy, like birds frolicking around in a nervous fashion and playing with each other because they have too much energy. They need to get rid of, come off with. Incessant. Nerves, in a positive sense, like excitement, but also laced with that nervousness of something energy that needs to be discharged. It reminds me of being a kid. I'm playing around with other children and being excited by them, but also a little bit afraid but just like with too much energy to spare.\",\n        \"This is like the last one, a bit but not as aggressive. You are sliding your sweaty hand across a windowpane, and because you're sweating, it's getting stuck. And it creates a vibration. Carelessness, freeing, because there isn't that much. I can't really detect that much of a pattern vibrationally. So it's letting me do its own thing. It's letting me do my own thing.\",\n        \"This feels a lot lighter for some reason, almost soft in a really weird way. It's not slippery, like the last one, a bit more soft as in a pillow. I feel like it feels like more of material as in something cloth-like than glass, and that is easy. It's more of a gentle sensation. It's quite kind, soft-spoken. There's a lot less friction, or it feels like it than the other ones. And it's quite calming. It feels more like you're painting or something than doing an action.\",\n        \"Yes, so this is very light. Yes. It's a bit strange. It's a bit ticklish in a way. It's a bit ticklish. It's becoming a bit itchy in a certain way. I'm just trying because I think, also because we practiced this now and especially at the end, they were required rough ones and on my fingers is like, is this it? There's nothing more coming? I think it's just very slight --. I think it's more like when you touch someone else it's like --. How do you call the hard skin? Yes, you feel that it's a little bit rough, but still like a soft skin could have been. It's not unpleasant. That's what I would say. This is fine. Just a bit weird. I wouldn't know for the rest of objects which I could link to it. Because this sounds like the see, so I'm like, is this sand? No, it's not rough enough to be sand. As for the rest, trying to think. It's very gentle in a way. It's being nice. It's not being hard on you. It's very slight. I think for the rest. Yes, maybe they're nice, but also, I think if I feel this for a long time, it would become annoying, like, okay, we're done.\",\n        \"This again reminds me of something small but something small that is going faster. So if I were to describe a vivid image, it would be something like a clown driving a motorcycle while doing juggling, but it's like a very small clown on a motorcycle. I would say it is again a repetitive pattern, but this one is faster, and the sensation is like if it was something super small touching the tip of my finger, but that is going fast. To me, the emotion is like when you are in a circus, and you're observing something that is fun, but it's like if you are looking at it from very far. Something that is intriguing, but you are looking at that from far. It is telling me that there is something interesting happening, but I need to get closer to see what exactly is happening.\",\n        \"I feel very little. It could be also an illusion as if the board would be turned off. It's like touching the paper. It's like a structural feeling. I ask myself if something's wrong with my finger. Did it stop to feel anything?\",\n        \"Nothing because I really can't feel this one.\",\n        \"It's very subtle. The surface feels a bit uneven again. It's almost like the friction caused my finger to vibrate across the glass when I move it. It's like someone you feel good around, like the emotions are very complimentary to your own. Yes, like kind of on the same emotion field. You're vibing.\",\n        \"I can't really tell the difference. It's a lot less than before. Actually, no, it feels smoother now. It feels very smooth. It doesn't help me glide along, but it feels easier to glide along. It's just very, very small resistance. Yes, maybe as if I was some sort of navigational --. I feel some resistance to every direction I push or pull in, as if there was weight behind each movement. Maybe in the context of swiping over a map, I would swipe uphill. I would follow a route. And I'll be going upstairs because it's harder to move forwards. Yes, a plate. Maybe if you get the last food of a plate or something.\"],\n       [\"This one feels like you have your hand on the printer, one of those big printers we have at work. And it also has the big scanner, and the copier and all that. It's shooting out pages like it's nobody's business. I don't know. You're printing a 200-page thing. And it's really in its rhythm. It is just shooting them out. I don't know. The description I just gave sounds like a boring task, but it's quite pleasing to me. I don't know. Yes, I feel satisfied. It's like mundane or more menial tasks like me doing laundry, for example. I feel like it fills me with --. It's not boredom. It's, I guess, satisfaction, but it's not an excitement either. It's quite rhythmic. It's quite fast. But the last one that I described as shaving that was fast in a way felt like you needed to keep up. This feels like fast the way that you're in a taxi or something. It's not you driving. This is happening, and you're a passenger in that sensation. I don't know. I'm watching these pages shoot out. I don't need to catch them. They're falling into the tray.\",\n        \"This one feels a bit like the sticker, but there's way more sticky stuff left on your CD. This is also nice when you leave it for a while, like a little buzz. Maybe it makes me think a little bit like polishing something to the point where it gets really squeaky clean. And it always wants to hear that squeaking noise from it. Maybe because it feels like there's slightly more resistance, but it's still quite constant.\",\n        \"This feels like a bit more friction than the last one. It's more like some plastic that has small dots on it or small rivets or something like that. I can feel it. And it's like this steady, constant thing. Emotionally, I don't really have a response to it, but I can feel like it's working against me or trying to make me slow down maybe a little bit but physically. It's more difficult to actually move my finger because there's this resistance. If I should describe it to someone else, I would say, like running a finger on the side of a matchbox, so some nimble small dots are running over my skin. And it feels a bit like physically stopping me in my tracks. I think that's what I get from it.\",\n        \"This one is like a straight-up dagger. It makes me think of these dagger waves, sawtooth, whatever, chainsaw. It's just constant and angular. Quick, fast-paced, but not aggressive. Being wired. You've had caffeine, but you don't have any natural energy. You're just like [onomatopoeia]. It's not unpleasant. It's not attached to what I would say is an anxious feeling, but it is like this feeling of artificial energy. It feels somewhat warm. It feels like when I put pink noise at night for me to relax, to go to bed, of sorts, but I still have some energy.\",\n        \"It's not obvious. I guess it's dragging my fingers through tar because it's quite slow. Yes, it's inconsistent. If I was to do this, then it would be like, this is a hard thing for me to do. I don't know.

Someone who is set in their waves wears black and white, stubborn.\",\n        \"That I can't really feel much. This is a lot harder to work out the feeling than the other ones. And I also don't know whether it's just because I've now run my fingers over the same spot. It feels a bit weird. It feels a lot harder, whereas the other one was really slippery. This feels harder for it to run my hand across. I don't know. It doesn't really feel like much. I'm not getting as much of a sensation of this one.\",\n        \"It's funny because, in the beginning, it felt like nothing, and then it really came out of nowhere. It is a build-up, or my fingers are just confused. I'm trying to think about what I'm feeling. It's a bit like the paper one I just got before. Okay, it's good. I felt that, though. I'm not just bullshitting. No, but there is something in the background I feel like with this one as well. It feels like, with this one, there is like a beat in the background. So it's much more music-related in my mind, I think. So what is it telling me? It's not really like the other music thing because that was much more like a beat. And this is more like, do you know the movie Jaws, like something's coming. It's much more like that. Where I'm like okay, so I think emotion wise I'm like, Jaws is like, there's a shark coming for you. So it's more like a bit tricky, more like danger, a bit more like thriller movie like, like there's someone sitting behind you with a knife kind of thing. So it's a bit horror, a bit scary, a bit murderous in a way.\",\n        \"I feel very small spikes, like if I were touching a lot of very small needles together. It is maybe like a small rhythm with a small pace. It's almost calm, like peaceful, like a peaceful experience, I would say. Yes, I would say calm and peacefulness definitely. It's almost like if I were playing a video game and I were in a very repetitive part of the game like that type of peacefulness that comes from repetition. This would definitely be someone that is doing something constantly like jumping like making an action but the same action constantly like jumping or running but not like running fast or running like almost jumping. Yes, someone in a very consecutive action.\",\n        \"That's again quite hectic like an alarm went off or something, like hey, wake up.

I would describe it as a pattern which is super rhythmic and repetitive, like an alarm that went off. Yes, I hate alarms because I love to sleep. It's like an impulsive and again tingly sensation. It's funny because this sensation gives me a feeling I can feel my nails. It's like filling my volume in my fingertips or something. It's weird.\",\n        \"This one feels very subtle as well.

Now I am doing a circle movement with my finger. Yes, it feels like I would operate some kind of device with that maybe where you have a dial that you crank something up like volume. Yes, like volume louder or quieter with small increments and bumps around the wheel. It feels like a lot of small to medium size bumps. And every now and again, there is a bigger one in there but not really that much bigger. It just feels like you can sense the distance that you go with your finger very well. Maybe something where you would have to really dial in on a specific value on a wheel or touchscreen wheel. Because you can feel every millimeter that you're moving forward, you can feel really well. That's a nice feeling. It feels good because you can feel where you're actually moving and how far are you are moving.\"],\n       [\"This one feels like or reminds me of a heart beating. I don't know if it does remind me of something. I would say it's quite consistent, quite rhythmic, and quite calming. I would say it sounds like a clock.

I feel some friction. Still, I'm trying to think. It's quite small. I can't tell if it feels like a different surface or if it feels like there's some stuff on it. Maybe it just feels a little dusty. Yes, but I'm trying to figure out what it would be. I feel this sensation more when I go this way, like diagonally. I'm not sure if that's me going crazy. I'm trying to figure out what it could be. I feel like a lot of things feel like cleaning a window somehow, but it feels like those windshield wipers. I feel like that's the sound my finger would be making on this.\",\n        \"It's passive, quiet. I don't know. I don't like this kind of people. It's like someone who lives with their five cats because it's a very low and annoying little buzz in the background. It was kind of hard for me to first even detect it and not even detect it. But I couldn't really understand if it was the buzz or my finger against the glass. Yes, it's telling me it's very coarse. It feels grainy. I'm sliding my finger across some small grains. Yes, I don't know. I've dropped salt, and for some reason, I'm doing eights in that with my finger.\",\n        \"This is like a heartbeat. This is literally like a heartbeat. It's almost like I'm lying next to someone, and their heart's beating. It's making me feel freaked out. If I close my eyes, I could be putting my hand on someone's chest rather than it's actually glass. So I am a bit shocked but astounded. Yes, just leaving next to someone, rubbing my hand on their chest, and you can feel their heartbeat. I'm feeling close to someone.\",\n        \"This one here is more pronounced than the other one. I would say this here is one of the more attention-grabbing ones that I've felt so far. I would assume that it would be able to take or catch my attention more easily than some of the other ones. And I think one of the reasons why that is is because it feels like there is more spacing between the vibrations as opposed to some of the other ones where it's it's a really, really sudden sound, sorry, a really, really subtle vibration. The frequency of them coming on is also very close together that it can just mud together almost where here I'm actually truly able to feel each and every vibration very clearly.

Certainly not on my first two fingers, but I'm getting something maybe on my third and on my pinky. Nonexistent, it really doesn't feel like it's there. I guess I used this analogy already, but like a very slow heartbeat like [onomatopoeia] with little tiny vibration on it. [onomatopoeia]. Maybe it's a dying bee. Sad.\",\n        \"This feels very slow, like the slow-motion videos of like a waterfall or like water on a river or something like that like very at its own pace.

I'm stuck to the glass. It's harder for me to move my finger away. It makes me feel a little bit trapped, I guess. I want to take my finger off, but I can't.\",\n        \"This one is very light. It feels like something is trying to break through the surface, but it can't because it's too light. It's more like grain or rice when you hold some rice in your hand, something small, maybe smaller than rice like couscous or something else. It feels calming. It's not too aggressive.

That's what it feels like. It makes me feel like I should do something like answering my phone. It's a bit demanding with that. But that's also because it's been playing for two minutes. It's not as intense as a phone, I think.\",\n        \"This feels like high-pitched speaking in some way. High-pitched screams. It is scary. It's surprisingly not any particular feeling.

This is like a whiteboard that I'm trying to erase or like a window that I'm trying to clean. It makes me feel a little bit frustrated because I feel like it should be smoother in some parts than others. I feel like my fingers are just being caught on some dirt or something when it should be really smooth. It's smooth, but your finger feels like it's being tugged by something small. I don't know. Maybe it's some kind of oil or grease or dirt. Yes, it really just feels like something's dragging on it, like some sort of tiny little thing, like a speck of dirt.\",\n        \"Okay, so this one is smooth, and then it hits a tiny bit of weight. I don't know. It reminds me of the sea or a very calm sea. I am not really sure because it doesn't really remind me of anything else I've experienced before in a touchscreen, especially. It feels dormant, like something is not right, or it's starting up. It's passive, to be honest. I don't know. A shaver that doesn't work. It feels like it confuses my finger because it's not really still, but it's also not really constantly buzzing or sending this vibration. So I think my finger is really confused. It's not something I would want to feel, actually. I think.\",\n        \"This is quite fun because it's a very constant beat, and it makes me want to keep touching the glass. I could almost think that there would be music playing. If somebody told me that I'm deaf and I'm listening to a song, I'd be like. I know this song. I could tell you what the song is. It makes me feel familiar with this beat. Up-beat. Connected. Having fun. It's very exciting and stimulating, and evolving. I would say stimulating is what I think of the most. Or bringing back to the sensation of like if you were at a party and then you're feeling the vibration of a speaker, and you're just like, this gets me going. This gets me in the mood to party.\",\n        \"So this one here is quite similar to the other one, just with even more spacing. And I would say it's in the same vein as the other one. There is a lot of the same things that hold true to this one here. I would say, however, that because the vibration pattern is spread out to this degree, it might feel maybe a little too sporadic. Yes, I would say maybe like a heartbeat almost. Let me just, one, two, three, four. So that's quite a high beat per minute for a heartbeat. But somebody who might be a little winded. Relaxation. I would say or something of lower physical effort, something like that.\",\n        \"Once again, I don't think I feel anything on any of the fingers. Maybe like a very light vibration on my pinkie, but I could be imagining it because I want to.\",\n        \"This is interesting. It feels like there's nothing, but there's actually something going on. It feels more like something in the air. They're not the finger in the skin that's touching the glass. Yes, it feels like vibrations in the air. Yes, I would say when you're cycling in Copenhagen, and the wind's against you, and then it's on your face. It's nice. It makes me feel surrounded. I think I feel it more on my hand or your knuckles more than my fingertips.\",\n        \"This one I have a hard time sensing. It feels like a very subtle sensation that's very quick as well. It almost isn't there, but it's just quickly, like a quick and very subtle vibration almost. I can mostly just sense the plate when there are no movements, but then quickly, there's like this vibrating thing that feels a little bit different. I think it kind of reminds me maybe of when I am using my phone, and I've turned on the sound, and I'm touching the screen while I get a notification somewhere else.\",\n        \"This is a very light sensation, like a beating sensation. It's like very light running in a way. It's a little bit sad. It doesn't feel happy. It's a bit too light to be happy. It's too slow to be happy, so it feels a bit more like a sad emotion. I sense slight touch and light touch or something maybe like small pebbles, small rocks. It could also be a small heartbeat just because of its beating and slides, more of a calm heartbeat. I think the only thing that comes to mind that it reminds me of is then a heartbeat, yes. But that can probably be applied to any beating sensation but a light heartbeat.\",\n        \"This one has around about the same intensity, but it's more frequent again. It has not that long intervals. I'm just going to talk. A spring morning. There's stuff happening around. There are birds singing and flowers growing. I don't know. There's stuff happening in there. It's more bright more about living. Especially since the other one was more sleepy, this one has a bigger contrast. I'm very much full of life and cheery, cheerful maybe, happy. It's more like a long thing, but it's also pretty soft. And then towards the end of the sensation, it has this a little stronger message. So it's soft in the beginning.\",\n        \"I remember this one. This was relaxing. It's like calm squeezes in your hand or like a quick hug in some way but multiple times. It's like still fast vibrations. But the level is not that significant from where there's no vibration, and it fades out. That's nice. I'm thinking about my mom or dad in some way. It's caring.\",\n        \"This one's well thought out, like you have a plan. You're going through a maze, and you have the map, and you know where you're going. Or you went for a run, and you know the way back home. Confident. Certain. You're making the right decisions without having to think. It's an unobnoxious feeling. I sense very rhythmic medium pulses, medium vibrations. Steve Irwin. Everything about Steve Irwin. He's got a cowboy hat on. He's got short shorts. He's got cowboy boots. I don't know. But he's an explorer. He's a safarist or a person who would take you on a safari adventure. He's really tanned, and he's probably got an accent.\"],\n       [\"Yes, it feels quite smooth, like putting your finger in water. I don't feel excited. I would say it's boring. Yes, this doesn't really feel like much is happening with this one. No, I don't feel distressed. I do feel slightly satisfied. No, it doesn't feel dominant.\",\n        \"I can feel vibrating. I don't know. It feels like maybe a wooden surface like that amount of friction. It feels like if I have a good speed, I can easily run it around. But when I go a little bit slower, it's harder. I feel a bit more friction, like the feeling of me passing through it. I'd say it's not as smooth as glass, but relatively smooth. Yes, it feels like a surface, like if I were on a table or something. It feels like my dinner table.\",\n        \"This feels low again, like something in the background. I'm touching a tiny motor, but it's not too vibrating. But it also, maybe, reminds you of pain. If it's tooth pain, it's something in the background. It feels like it's just aching or vibrating. I think it's someone very stable, actually someone who is so confident and maybe like a leader. Yes, it's like a stable, confident person. I already said stable, continuous, in a way calming, maybe because it doesn't change. It's just going to continue until you turn it off.\",\n        \"This is a very gentle beat. It's probably the hardest I've, from the warm-up, experienced beyond distinguishing between the friction of the glass and my finger. It's almost something I have to concentrate on to be able to feel properly. It's a very constant sensation. I can almost forget about it if I just keep my finger on the glass for too long, forget that it is there. Bland. Boring. Not very interesting. I  don't really get much out of this sensation, so I think it makes me less invested. And if it was a person, it would probably be someone I wouldn't be interested in talking to. It's almost like being at the beach and just running my hands through the sand if the sand was a bit colder. It doesn't have any rhythm to it, so I think that's why.\",\n        \"So first of all, I would say, again, it feels a little bit more muddy in the sense that the vibration pattern is not as clearly defined or distinctively on-off if you'd say. It's more wavy in that sense. I would say, especially with something like this, where the sensation is so subtle, to begin with, you really have to feel to try to distinguish it. If I had to focus on other things while doing this, I think I would have a hard time allocating enough cognitive energy towards actively distinguishing this pattern here. I would say it makes me feel indifferent, almost. I don't know. It just doesn't really invoke anything special in me as opposed to a lot of the other ones. This one here feels just feels a little bit more indifferent.\",\n        'Nothing on the first or second. Maybe I feel something super, super light again. Feels like running my finger over glass, but with a little bit more friction, I guess, like little tiny bumps. There is tiny, tiny, not even sand, smaller than sand on it, possibly. Yes, reminds me of running your finger through sand for some reason.',\n        \"This feels like there's something going on underground. It's like five minutes before an earthquake where you might feel the vibrations, but it's not as intense. There's a potential danger that's sort of coming. I would be very cautious. I would be very like think about twice before I say anything. I don't know. I have to be a little more risk-averse and put my guards up. Yes, I don't know. It feels light on my finger but also feels like there's a lot more impact to wait after from.\",\n        \"I can't sense that much different from before. It's still pretty easy, but sometimes it feels like there's a little bit more friction. I think just swiping on your phone or swiping on a window. I don't really attach any emotions to it. Yes, I guess because it feels like touching my phone, it just feels like a pretty regular feeling to have.\",\n        \"This feels more like sliding along. I don't feel hindered in my finger movement. It's more like ice skating. I feel like it's helping me along. It feels a bit happier. It's telling me to keep moving and not stop, just keep moving my finger. It's like ice skating, not really being able to stop. It's a very calm sound, a bit high pitched but still not that it hurts but still calming like a very high operatic voice but in a calm way.\",\n        \"I'm not even sure if they have a frequency. It's like the whole glass is vibrating. It's like those little vibrations. They're not that intense, but they're everywhere on the glass. I mean, I think they're always everywhere, but it also feels like they're there all the time. It's like an electric toothbrush that also vibrates all the time. It doesn't really talk to me. It doesn't really want me to do something. It doesn't really have something big to say. It's just there. There's no real message behind it or stuff like that like the other ones. It's very, very quiet, maybe even shy, but with much to say because there's a little vibration behind it, though. So she had something to say, but it wouldn't really come out. Maybe a little anger in the background. But very quiet.\",\n        \"This is soothing but also annoying because you can't feel it entirely. So it's more like, are you there or not? I guess, relax, but not like relax. It's more whispering relax. It's like constant feedback. It's always here like a massage but without really feeling the massage. I think it's when you're having a massage and there's music. No one's touching you, but it's before they start to massage you. It's the music that you constantly feel that you know that you're in a place where you have to relax.\",\n        \"This one reminds me of being at the zoo and seeing elephants. For some reason, it reminds me of if I were to touch the trunk of an elephant and kind of feel the roughness of their skin. I imagine their skin being almost like touching a fish's skin like a shark or a seal. It's smooth but also a little bit rough. It makes me happy. It makes me feel childish. It makes me feel naive. It makes me feel ecstatic. It tickles, but you want to keep touching it because you feel joy. It is very light, very pleasant. It's telling me to go buy that cotton candy, go touch that dog, do things, be ambitious, go do it. You are a kid, and the world is your oyster. Go have that adventure.\"],\n       [\"This one feels quite strong. This one honestly feels like shaving a little bit, like you're using an electric razor. Just the actual vibrations on my hand feel a little bit like that. This is quite constant. There is a pulse, but there are no gaps, if that makes sense. It's more steady. The fact that it is quite fast does make you feel urgent. I feel like I'm moving my finger faster. It almost feels a little bit like you're at a club, but the techno is very hard and fast. And it's just like not noise, but it's not necessarily rhythmic. I don't know. Yes, but that's just because of the pace. The actual sensation is quite pleasing and nice and soft, a little bit like shaving. With the techno thing, what I meant by that was the tempo of the pulse a little bit more. The pulse that I am feeling anyway is quite fast, almost like a heavy bass line. But it's not like when you're listening to hard techno like [onomatopoeia]. It's not like rhythmic or like constant, whereas this feels rhythmic and constant, but it's just also fast. I don't know. It's not relaxing and maybe slightly stressful, but it feels nice though. It's maybe a little bit like you're coming towards the end of giving a presentation, and it's going well so far. You're like, we're nearly out of the woods, but you're still in quite a high-pressure situation. It doesn't feel not nice, but it also is not relaxing.\",\n        \"It's a little bit happy, not happy-happy, but I don't feel depressed or anything. It feels quite benign. I keep thinking of braille, but, I mean, I have very limited knowledge of what you can use this tech for, I think. It doesn't really remind me of anything I felt before. I don't think, not in terms of anything electric or anything. Tingly. It's like a tingly buzzing.\",\n        \"This feels like quite a lot of friction. It also feels tingly, as if an electrical current is running through me. It feels like a weak electrical fence or something like that. You can feel the tingling. I don't really feel like it's trying to tell me anything. It feels very constant. It feels like it's there all the time. It doesn't really evoke any feelings. It's just there. I don't really think that it reminds me of anything. It should be an electric fence or something like that, but a very small voltage. I don't know. Maybe a bit of excitement. That is not an action. Or doing something that you have to gather up the courage to do, I would say. But it's not a specific action that I could do. But I think I'm just relating it to the electrical fence. I think that's the main action that I'm feeling or associating it with.\",\n        \"This feels like buzzing, similar to the other sawtooth. It feels a bit faster and less deep, more shallow. Constant background noise. Someone with a work ethic, which just goes and does things and has this consistency to their action. And there is low-level determination without drama. It's that running, but not running in the moment, that running over many days and just the action of incorporating running into your life. And so, if you were to imagine doing it for a few months and as a committed action.\",\n        \"This one is a bit like the last one. It just feels like panic, like a heart palpitation or something. Okay, now I'm getting more into it. I mean, it makes me feel alert and aware. I guess I'm doing a lot of work moving around. I guess, panic a bit. It just feels like spiraling into dread because it's quite subtle. The actual sensation is quite subtle, but the more I glide my fingers across the glass, the more I feel.

I think this could be wrapping paper, I feel like. What else could I relate it to? It's not rough enough to be a kiwi. No, but like a very bald kiwi. I don't know. I think just as like the wrapping paper, and like the kiwi, it's like a wrapping of something. I don't know why that's telling me but more like packaging or something.\",\n        \"This one, I don't know why, but it reminds me a lot of the sea. It reminds me a lot of almost like touching the waves when a wave is coming to you and then going back to the sea. It makes me feel like I'm touching something that is moving if I were touching a wave that is coming in and then a wave that is coming back. In the feeling, I feel, again, a pattern, but this time the pattern is first a little faster and then a little slower and then a little faster and then a little slower.

I can just feel it.\",\n        \"It definitely feels like there are some breaks on my finger, almost. It's heavy. It's like when you use your finger on the touchpad or something, but everything is more heavy to move past. Something's weighing you down.

It reminds me of working and cleaning at my old gym, where I cleaned those mirrors.\",\n        'Okay. This feels super sticky again. Not really vibrations but less sliding like super super super tiny vibrations. But it feels like my skin is sticking more to the surface, though.

A nice sound, just like ongoing notes being held.'],\n       [\"I'm not sure I am feeling this one. It doesn't feel like there's as much of a pulse as the last one, maybe. I don't know. I don't know if it's maybe because this one feels maybe more active or something, and I'm not feeling as much in the pulsing, but maybe more just of a general tingling or something. I don't know. I'm not feeling it super strong, so it's hard to say. It's almost like you're petting a cat or something, but a cat with not very long hair. And it was robotic. It's pleasant. I don't know.

It feels very fast, but also, it just feels like touching something with friction. I don't really get any signals out of it or feel like it wants me to do something. It's just like a small vibration in my finger. Yes, it makes it a bit more difficult. I don't know if it reminds me of something I felt before. Maybe it's the kind of feeling when I've just peeled an orange. And I get this slight friction on my skin because of the juices of the orange. I can get friction from that.

This sensation feels like it's in the glass a bit further. It has a strange rhythm to it. It's almost like a heartbeat of some sort. There's the buzz, and then there is some kind of app below. [onomatopoeia]. It feels a bit like the sound of a base outside of a club where you can feel it on these surfaces around you because it has the melodic aspect to it, like a sense of complexity, which sounds like it's been produced by a human. It's some kind of variance to it.\",\n        \"This one is more soothing, more relaxing, more tender. It's not as violent or as assertive.

It does really feel like I have a window that's just been cleaned or something because it's like the feeling of glass, but a bit slippery. You spilled something on a surface.

Now I can't get the guitar out of my mind. Yes, that's the same person with the bass guitar. Yes, I'm trying to think of more adjectives. Quite okay because it doesn't feel very alien.

Yes, it's like when you're watching a cartoon, and then someone accidentally is shaking, and then it has a sound.

Again, this is an object that you can really hold well in your hands.

The last one was quite direct. This one feels less involved or something. I don't know. Yes, I feel satisfied. This one definitely feels positive, like if you were playing a game or something and you had a remote controller. I'm not a gamer.

I think, emotionally, compared to the other ones, I'm a little bit relieved when I feel this one. Yes, maybe a relief.\",\n        \"It feels very draggy. Yes, I'm thinking of dragging. It's holding me back, but this is not pushing me. This is more pulling me. It's more of a pulling emotion. It also feels like trying to run away from someone who is holding you back. Someone is having their arms around your waist or something, and you try to get away from them. I feel like that's the feeling that I get from this. I'm getting pulled towards something. It feels not rough, but I don't feel that much, I think. When I run my finger over this, I can imagine the sound of it squeaking, like when you rub a glass or something with some water on it.

Subtle.\",\n        \"I can't feel that much, but initially, when it changed, I think it felt a bit tingly.

A thing that is very slight, but I feel like when someone sticks you with a needle but then slighter, like not really like that, but just a little bit annoying, just like, I don't know, prickly in a way.

In my finger, I feel two ticks like ticks from the clock like [onomatopoeia] and then one large beat. Yes, it makes me feel that if this were an entire scene of a movie or a video game, it would be like the sound that is telling me like there's something about to happen, but it's also showing the event that is happening. It is almost like the last part of the joke. You already said the premise, and then you say the last part of the joke.

A little needy, like calling for attention all the time, like hey, I need some help, hey, did you know that about me, hello. I can tell that there's a fade-out in the sensation.

It feels similar to that, almost like a brushed metallic, like a brushed metal texture, maybe, a little bit.\"],\n       [\"It reminds me of something creaky, like a seesaw or something. It also feels like when you run your fingers down a knife-edge as well. No, I don't feel excited. I guess I would just describe it to someone else, as I said before, like when you run your finger down a blunt knife, like a kitchen knife, and that has got a rugged edge. No, it doesn't feel dominant. It feels quite neutral, I would say. I associate it with sawing something. I would say it feels slightly uncomfortable.\",\n        \"It feels like I'm just getting lightly shocked, like [onomatopoeia]. Yes. Okay. It's not as strong, but it reminds me of an electric fence. I've been shocked by an electric fence, and that's quite strong. This isn't so strong. This has an electric current running through it. Yes, I can't associate anything, but it just feels like I'm working with --. Maybe if you're playing laser tag, this sort of feels like what it is like to shoot somebody or to be shot. You get a little rumble that there's a pass of electricity. It doesn't hurt. It's not scary. It feels like I felt something. It feels quite neutral.\",\n        \"Somehow, this one feels even worse in some cases, especially when you slide your finger up. If I could hear it right now, I think it's gonna make a creaking sound. It feels like there's a bit of vibration when I move it faster, a bit like electricity balls in those science centers. But it also makes me want to put all my fingers there. Yes, electrical buzzing. So it's maybe a sound a bee makes or a beehive. If I would have to put a sound again to this one, for instance, it's maybe like a motor running. It's not good.\",\n        \"I don't know if I'm saying this because I am still on that party vibe. It's more like being against a speaker and hearing the beat of a song but not as upbeat. It's more like when you are at a concert, and there's an in-between act, and it's so silent, and they're just playing that music while nothing is happening, but they just want something to be playing. Ominous or shady. I'm not sure if I could really trust them. They're constantly being a bit hooded and not that open and a bit keeping to themselves. Maybe a bit like threatened and wary.\",\n        \"I would say this one here is a little bit harder to feel. I would say it feels like a rugged, uneven surface, almost like if you were to touch something like a brick wall or something, something that's just a little uneven. I would describe it as a person, that is. I don't know. I guess I would at least describe it as a person who would not have smooth skin. I don't know what kind of connotations that would bring up. I don't know.\",\n        \"Nothing on first. Nothing on second. Feels like this one is maybe like another pulsing one, perhaps. It's like [onomatopoeia] but once again super light, can't really feel it. I don't know. I don't love it for some reason. It doesn't feel super good. I can definitely feel it a bit more now that I'm touching it more. Yes, it's grand. I wouldn't be annoyed if this was on my phone. I don't know if I'd feel it if it was on my phone. I would describe it as a gentle buzz, pulsing, that goes on and off and on and off, and it's not continuous.\",\n        \"It's like faster vibrations. I don't know. Have you seen tractors on the farm that just make a lot of vibrations, and then they're just passing by. That would be it. The sensation is not too heavy. It's just that the vibrations are fast. If you're on a highway and then you hear something go by really fast. I don't know, maybe anxiety a little because it's like fast vibrations and anxious thoughts. Yes, it just feels like it's not rough, but it's faster on my fingertips, like something running across on my fingertips.\",\n        \"Sometimes the friction increases, and it feels again like you're getting electrocuted like a warning that you should take your finger off. The sensation is not there all the time. It's just some of the time. Yes, I would describe it as a more sticking emotion to the plate some of the time and then like a more easy sliding feeling the rest of the time. Yes, like a subtle warning that you should take your finger off or something is wrong. Maybe the friction when you touch a balloon.\",\n        \"This feels more forceful. It's more putting the brakes but still a bit random and chaotic. It feels like it's trying to stop my finger but not doing a very good job because it's a bit too light. It's stronger than the other ones but still too light to stop my finger. It feels like when you ride a bike on rocks, and it kind of vibrates. It is a bit angrier than the other ones because it's a bit more forceful but not too angry, just slightly mad.\",\n        \"This one is more constant. It feels like it's more everywhere, and it's also a bit stronger, I think. It doesn't feel natural. It feels electric. It doesn't feel alive. This one is not calming, but it's also not making you feel awake or something. We had that one that was more like an alarm clock, and this one is more calm. It's also just more than the other ones before this, too. It's hard to say what it's really telling me. Maybe you could use it in a game or something to make it build up the tension. Yes, like excitement, maybe. And the feeling of something coming up, something happening.\",\n        \"I don't know about this one. It's like a bird chanting. Maybe being on vacation in a tropical place. Wake up, maybe.\",\n        \"This makes me want to slow down to really appreciate it. It feels like ice skating. Very smooth and melodic. A graceful person who's sly or charismatic? This reminds me of being outside, specifically near Fredriksberghave, the gardens in Fredriksberg, where there's this ice skating rink. I guess colder winter. It's very good. It feels really natural. It doesn't feel forced. It's very, yes, natural. I feel relaxed. I can let my guard down. What's the word? Vulnerable. Secure.\"],\n       [\"I'm not really feeling very much from this one, but it's nearly there. I feel like if I get myself into the rhythm, I'll be able to. Not really, because I don't feel enough to actually say one way or another.\",\n        \"This feels a little bit more intrusive again. I feel like we're back to the slightly more aggressive ones in a way like it feels a little bit more aggressive. I keep thinking of the sticker again. The sticker stuff, it feels like that. It feels like I expect to take my finger off, and there would be something on my finger that was in the way. It doesn't feel painful or annoying or anything. It's just like there's some kind of obstruction.\",\n        \"Yes, it feels like the sound of going over a glass, but not making music on it, but more like washing your windows or something like that. It feels like a squeaky noise. And I can feel it's pulsating. But it doesn't really communicate to me, or it doesn't feel like communication. It feels more like a part of the surface or something that's just there when I'm running my fingers over it. I would say it's like when you are cleaning your kitchen, and you run the cloth over a dirty area where it stops in its tracks but then continues going on. Yes, I would say cleaning the kitchen counter.\",\n        \"This one is almost melodic. It feels similar to the paradiddle one where you can sense it has a very particular rhythm like [onomatopoeia]. It's more meditative and a bit deeper than the paradiddle one. It feels a bit thicker and a bit more like there is ambiance to it. It made me think of being at a club with house music, and it has that more kind of deep house, maybe. There's this kind of ambiance and this warmth to it. It's the same rhythm that goes around and around and around. It feels less dispersed than the other ones. It feels like it's one surface which is making contact. It's like everything which my finger is touching is receiving the sensation rather than like lots of different points. And it feels more like a larger body.\",\n        \"Okay, this one's a bit more peppy. Yes, this is telling me something. This is like my alarm going off in the morning. Peppy. I don't know if that's an adjective. Excitable. I guess erratic, but also energetic, but also worried and anxious because it's all happening. There's a lot of vibrations. Alarmed.\",\n        \"It's got an odd sensation. It doesn't feel completely smooth anymore, but a little bit more like your fingers getting stuck. But it's not consistent. It feels a bit like if you've got rubber boots on like rubber Wellies. And you go into someone's house, and you brush your feet, and because there's something about the two materials together, it feels like it's getting stuck. I mean, it's not unpleasant. It just feels like there's something in the way that this makes them stick. My hands are a bit sweatier than they were a few seconds ago, but it doesn't feel like that on my actual hand, just on the glass. As it gets stuck, that's an area that should be paid more attention to. There's a reason why it's getting stuck or at least feels like that like caught rather than stuck, I guess.\",\n        \"I am just trying to figure out what I'm feeling. Sometimes it's better to take a little bit more time, I feel like. I'm trying to think of how this one is different than the other ones. This one is a bit confusing because I don't know if I'm feeling a surface or whether it's more like electric pulses or the thing I was talking about, a beat or not. I don't know. I feel like this is just a weird cocktail of the ones I just felt. It's not unpleasant. I just have no clue what's going on. I think because it's a little bit like you're touching a surface, there is some kind of current going through your finger. But then it's like a weird mix because there's also a pause in it. It's not constant. It's not stable. It's a bit putting you off. If you have to try to find a word, it's chaos. I have no clue what is happening.\",\n        '[empty]',\n        \"It's like I would stroke a material which has a profile of little lines. It makes me feel like I pay attention to someone who's talking, and meanwhile, I'm stroking this surface.\",\n        \"That's really hard to describe. A little tingling, maybe. It's telling me to relax.\",\n        \"The movement feels like I have to force it almost. It's more obstructive, the friction. I get these small sensations of bumps again almost as I move across. This feels like somebody, almost like trying to hold you back. Like wouldn't want the best for you, but drains you, drains your energy, drains your emotions. Not the type of person that you need in your life.\",\n        \"This one feels like a lot of small bumps again but also bigger ones in between every few centimeters, I feel like. A normal person, like every day you and me. Nothing really special, but still nobody you would overlook on the streets. You'd notice them, but they don't look weird or anything. I mean, I can feel it really good now, but I can't put any action on it that I would associate it with. This one even feels more like it, like the texture you sometimes get on your laptop next to the trackpad. This one slides a bit, and then it catches you up again like a textured metal maybe, like brushed chrome or something.\"],\n       [\"Yes, this one feels a lot stronger. It feels like you're getting an electric shock. It's like, I don't know if you have it in Germany that game, what's it called? It's like the little man on the operating table. And then you have to put the organs into him using the little tools. And then it gets a shock if you hit his body. No, I don't feel satisfied. Yes, it probably makes me feel more excited than the other ones so far. Yes, it does feel dominant.\",\n        \"This is quite smooth, still. The first thing that came to my mind was an ice rink after some people had been skating on it for a while. It's relatively smooth, but you can feel that there's some friction there sometimes. Some people have messed up the ice a little bit. If I think very closely about it, I can feel like there's some vibration on it that I sometimes feel more than other times. It's quite a light vibration that I feel. It's like a small little like snow ice pieces. That's what I feel like. It feels kind of smooth but also soft.\",\n        \"Okay, talking about doing nothing, this one also feels that I'm having some impact. It's just like if there were little hills that are kind of hairy, and I'm brushing above them. I'm searching for them with my finger. It almost feels like I could trace some kind of pattern or some kind of landscape. There's actually nothing there. Or if the glass would have different textures, this would give a different texture like hair or something. I think of an old grandma or grandpa, the one who sits in his chair and reads newspapers, just complaining about TV or radio or something. It's loving and nice. Or a cat that purrs, maybe, but a nice cat, not the one who attacks you. I feel alive, maybe. I know I said cat and grandma, but I meant more like nature-wise of like different patterns and different landscapes and materials and textures. And if I wouldn't see the glass or not look at it, I would imagine that there would be whole ornaments of stuff and a landscape of different colors and textures and stuff. It's telling me there's something I can't see. But I can discover that this was a game for kids or something, or you can touch somebody else, a blind person. I would be touching someone's face or something.\",\n        \"This is a soft vibration, but it's got a beat to it, so it's more fun. I'm spinning on a DJ set. Yes, disco. I think jamming a jam, like a jam session. It feels really gentle, soft, but also really energetic, or not energetic, like soft, gentle but connected. So just relax, chill out, have a good time, almost like being in a bodega with a good group of friends, and the music's not too heavy, but you know you're having fun. It's just like a really feel-good kind of music and environment. And it's not really a consistent beat, which probably made me think of being more social.\",\n        \"I would say maybe a little bit it reminds me of some of the actions that my Apple Watch does. So again, in comparison to some music sounds where you might have something that goes up in pitch or down in pitch to signify something, the Apple Watch does the same thing with vibration, where it will go up in vibration pitch and down in vibration pitch to communicate something. This feels like it's coming in these waves of vibration in the same way but more monotone. Yes, it feels like these waves or a surge of vibration that comes on and off and like an on-off pattern. So something that signifies something that is a binary state. It's there, or either it's not there. On-off. No, I can't come up with any adjectives.\",\n        \"Nothing on the first. Nothing on the second. No, I don't think I'm getting anything at all this time. No, I've got nothing to say on that. It's nothing there.\",\n        \"I don't know if I'm feeling anything. Is this going to change? Yes, I don't think I'm feeling anything. Yes, I just feel the glass.\",\n        \"This, again, feels very even but still a little bit more heavy movement across the plate. It's pretty comfortable because it's the same feeling constantly on my finger. I can just keep moving my finger on the screen. I don't have to remove it or anything because it's pretty pleasant. Yes, touching a window or touching a regular screen. Yes, I think touching a window, not when it's cold, but just like a regular body temperature glass screen.\",\n        \"This is a bit weirder than the other one. It's not a beating, a bit more random. Still very light. It still feels like walking on pebbles, small rocks. Maybe using an eraser on paper can be associated with this one because it's a bit random at times and feels like you're rubbing on something. It doesn't really make me feel like a lot. It's just a bit too random to get a grasp on what it is. If this was a person, I would characterize them as a bit chaotic but still calm in a way because it's a very light sensation but maybe a bit stressful.\",\n        \"It's not that much friction at the moment, I would say. It's more like a really uneven surface. It's not that big things in between like they were in the warm-up period. It feels kind of normal, I think. There's no time in between the frictions. There's a little time in between these frictions, but it doesn't feel weird or anything. I think it would annoy me on a smartphone, though, if it was like this all the time. It kind of doesn't remind me of anything because it's a little like incy-wincy electrical shocks or something that are coming and going. I don't think I've ever experienced that before. It's nothing natural. It's not talking. It's not telling me to wake up or something because I think I've had that before. It's more quiet.\",\n        \"This is annoying. It's not continuous, and it's not that significant. You don't know what it wants. God, this is annoying, super annoying. Tell me what you want. Jesus. Not good. Frustrated. A frustrating feeling. Like noise.\",\n        \"It's a little confusing, untrustable, or at least something to be wary of. Cautious. It makes me feel like I should be aware of something, that there's something coming in. But I can't predict it. Anticipation. It feels like there's sand underneath my finger. It's inconsistent because the grains of sand could be of different sizes or something like that. You're hitting these random patches of sand.\"],\n       [\"This one feels like dramatic music in a movie. It's like a bad bit in a movie. Someone is being chased or something. It feels like it goes from low to high on a loop. It reminds me of those lights that you get in science museums, and it's like a globe. And there's a light and then when you touch it the light comes to your finger and then you can move the light. It feels like that. I don't know.\",\n        \"Okay. It's like a surface that isn't completely smooth, like a wall that's been painted over. It's not quite sandpaper, but you can tell that there is something between you and the smooth surface. Yes, it's how I imagine that wall would feel. Yes, it's some kind of wall or painted furniture, maybe even a chalkboard, something like that. I don't know if the sensation gives me emotions. I don't particularly like it just because it makes me feel like if I scratch at it, it will make a sound. Or I might get something on my nails. But doing this doesn't make me feel any emotions.\",\n        \"This one is like it has the same motor running, like what I said, like this kind of electrical feel, but it's more smooth. I feel like maybe if I were playing a game on glass or like a touchscreen, then this one would show that something has been done like a goal has been reached. It's not a nasty buzz like the last ones. It feels like I'm doing something. If I look right at my hands, I would imagine maybe I'm drawing with a paintbrush, a  rusty paintbrush. It's not in a bad way. It gives a sense of accomplishment, maybe. It's exactly that. You have a brush at the top of your finger, and you're brushing something away, or you're painting a picture if I would move it faster. Yes, I guess that's a good explanation. It's like a little brush on my fingers.\",\n        \"This is quite light, fluffy, almost like running my hands on a dog or something fluffy. It makes me feel quite comforting. Soft. Furry. Cushiony. Not velvety per se, but it's quite light. Comforting and sweet and cuddly. Giving my dog a hug. Petting my dog while she's cuddling next to me. It's almost like a little heartbeat of an animal where you just feel it. I don't know.\",\n        \"It's very subtle. It almost feels like it's pulsing. Maybe it's just the way that I touch it. It's like some of the other ones. I don't know why I keep returning to this word stabby, but it's just the sensation of it being. The attack of the sound is quite hard, and it's decaying quite fast. So it comes on really quickly, and it leaves really quickly. So it's not like the sine wave. It's not really like a slow beat, but it's very up and down.\",\n        \"Okay, it seems I've got a numb first finger because there's nothing happening there. Not much going on with the second. No, I don't think I'm really getting anything.\",\n        \"Okay, this seems a little more subtle than the other one. Yes, it reminds me of a pulse maybe, more like a pulse than like a buzzing sort of thing. It feels very light, lighter than the previous one. Yes, it's almost like I have to pay attention to the sensation before I can feel it. I don't know. I have to focus a lot more and pay attention. I don't know, like space and pulse and flashes of red. Very stoic and that not as expressive.\",\n        \"This feels very even in a regular motion. For me, it's very similar to touching a glass window or screen again. It's kind of the same association, just like a slippery surface that's even. Everything is okay and normal. I don't have to pay attention to anything. I can just keep swiping or sliding my finger.\",\n        \"This is, again, a bit like ice-skating, but whereas the other one before was very constant, then this one I can feel each step I take or each skate I take. I don't know what it's called. Every time I take a step with the ice skates, I can feel it here just sliding along. It's a very smooth sensation and a very light, happy one. It's a very, very clear sensation. This is not very grainy. It's telling me to keep going, keep moving along. It's also this one-two beating that is just repeated all the time. Though, it is slowing me down a bit with every step I take.\",\n        \"Yes, those are way longer. Those are more quiet. They're more soft. They're also more intense than the last ones. I feel them more, but they're not that annoying because they're not that frequent. They're kind of smooth. I don't know. It reminds me kind of sleeping for some reason. It's quiet, and it's sleepy. It's snoozing. It's dreaming, maybe snoring. And it's quiet. It's in another world. I like that one.\",\n        \"This is also very relaxing. This is like a calm heartbeat. Yes, relaxing. I feel very good. Comfort like I'm safe. I feel like if I had to have a shot like a shot of like a vaccine or something, then if I felt this, I would be calm. Everything is gonna be okay in some way.\",\n        \"This reminds me of riding a rusty bike. When you're pedaling, there's something rusty about the bike. It's just difficult. I would describe this as daunting, almost perseverance in a way to make you work harder than you have to. It's a little bit ticklish. I think it's more the rhythm for me that is making me feel that way. But the actual feeling is good. It's not a bad feeling. The touch reminds me of your stomach growling. This makes me think of a drunk guy at a bar who is overweight, and he's losing his hair. He smells like beer. Just a rough guy.\"],\n       [\"I would say it feels quite similar to the last one. I would associate it with when you hold a balloon and then you put your arm down it. No, not your arm, your hand down the balloon and feel the, what's the word --. God, I don't remember the word. I don't really associate any adjectives with it. It just feels squeaky on my finger. It also makes my hand feel numb as well. It makes me feel slightly distressed, actually, more than the last one. I don't feel satisfied, no.\",\n        \"It's like a light rumbling, sort of like a tummy growling like a stomach growling a bit or like your hands on your dog or your cat or something. I don't know. I like it. It doesn't feel fuzzy as in fur, but fuzzy as in like [onomatopoeia] sort of like petting a bee. Yes, it's buzzy, I guess. Yes, it's a vibration. It's like rumbling a little bit under my touch.\",\n        \"Okay, this one is like the hum, what I was talking about before. It feels slower, more of a deeper voice if there would be a voice. It's not as pleasant as the last one. And it makes me feel like there is something wrong. If I had to put it as an adjective or in a story, then it would be dark in some way. So it gives negative feelings, but not in an irritating way like the first two, but more sinister. Or again, you're playing a game, and something bad happens. Yes, it's lower. If this was music, it would probably be bass or something.\",\n        \"It's like skating, like ice skating, and when you like to slide along the ice, it's like [onomatopoeia]. Quite nice. Quite like gliding. And relaxing. I think because it's such a long sensation in beat, it's making me feel really calm. Really empathetic because it's almost like the glass is listening to me and being patient with me. I'm just feeling it out. So I would say the person would be a person I would want to talk to and talk deeply with.\",\n        \"It's a pleasant feeling, but it has these little abrupt stops in the pattern. Yes, compared to some of the other sensations I had in the training, I would say this feels more as if you would have slightly sweaty fingers and you were touching on a piece of glass. So this is more akin to that feeling, though not completely the same, but it feels like that. So at times, I feel like it can be a little difficult to distinguish between whether it's actually the glass or if it's the sensation. I don't know because I would say maybe it's too subtle to really grab my attention. I would say. Now I'm just thinking aloud. So let's say it was a notification or something that tried to catch my attention, then I would feel like it was a little bit underwhelming, but maybe for other things, it might work better. It feels okay. I will say again. In the vibration patterns going up and down, as I said before, it feels they're these small, little abrupt stops between the oscillation, which again feels like it's a super subtle feeling. But yet still, it has this edginess to it or this sharp stop edginess to it. It's the best way I can describe it.\",\n        \"I think this one is even fainter than the first two. It is so hard to know whether it's the screen or --. Don't really feel like I'm feeling anything. There might be a slight buzz. The first one was like somebody who's doing tiny steps. The second one was like skipping. This is even more continuous than steps like a razor or something, but super, super light because I'm not even sure if I'm really feeling anything. Not much, because I can't feel it. Nothing, I think. I would be trying to make something up here because I am really not feeling much.\",\n        \"Yes, it's very mild in a sense. It's like a small buzzing that goes on. No, not particularly. I think it's just a more gentle soft sort of vibration. I don't know if you have a bee buzzing in your ear, but imagine that as a sensation. I don't know. I can think of like blue sort of colors is what I would associate with it. No, I don't know, just my phone, I guess. Yes, that's it.\",\n        \"It's very easy or comfortable to touch the screen. Yes, it feels like there's not much friction at all. It feels very light. It's a clean surface I'm touching, an even surface. It kind of reminds me of an ice skating rink before anyone has been on it. Very pleasant and comforting, like someone who's nice being around it. It makes me feel relaxed.\",\n        \"It feels a bit softer. It feels like every time I feel it, it's gradually becoming harder and then softer again because, like there's a curve to it, some attack and release. This is a very calm person, a very mother-like person, somebody who won't really get angry quickly. It feels like it's easing me into the sensation. That's being nice to me. It makes me feel calm, relaxed.\",\n        \"This one is very smooth. It's not that intense. It's very long. It's a very constant vibration. It's like real friction would feel. It's like going over a table that is kind of sticky, maybe, because there's so long that you feel them for a very long time. And then when they stop just for a second, then it's like not that sticky thing on the table. It's like that, I would say. It's very quiet. It's telling me to keep calm, maybe like it's tired. It's like the glass doesn't want to make those big sensations anymore. Yes, it's like moving your hand on a surface that is kind of sticky and not very smooth or anything. I mean, the glass is smooth, obviously, but the vibrations make it really unsmooth and give it something. It's like that paper with which you make surfaces smooth that red paper thingy, like this maybe.\",\n        \"It's kind of like the same as the one before. If I had to compare it to the one before, then this is more significant and more in control. Authoritative. Caring. Authority.\",\n        \"This one reminds me of a frog ribbiting. Being in an area that is humid and there's water around, maybe smelly. This one also makes me feel curious, like a sense of adventure, wanting to go see what's going on. Discovery. This is telling me to come in. The water is warm. You're invited. Yes, sit down. There's a fireplace right here and maybe a few beers. I would describe this person as being mysterious, but in a sense, that they're uncanny. There are multiple levels of depth. Deep.\"],\n       [\"This one feels quite regular. It's not super, super strong, but you can kind of definitely feel more of a pulse. This reminds me more of the first one. I don't know if that's actually a helpful answer if they're going to be sequenced, whatever. All I can think of is adjectives now, but it's quite direct, and it's quite regular. And I don't feel distressed other than the fact that I can't think of any nouns. This feels more like you have a fancy alarm clock that wakes you up by giving you very gentle vibrations. That's what this feels like to me.\",\n        \"This feels like there's a lot more resistance all of a sudden, like jagged. It's a little bit irksome. I don't know. It's annoying. It feels a bit frustrating because it comes and goes, and then it is really resistant all of a sudden, and you don't expect it to be. It's like help. Where did that come from? It's a bit annoying. It makes me think a little bit of like walking through snow on grass. And you don't know what's underneath. And suddenly you step in a hole, and you're like, fuck, was this hole a minute ago, and then you're stumbling.\",\n        \"This feels soft in a way. It doesn't really have that much of a texture. Maybe if I'm really concentrating on it, it feels more like lines more than it feels like dots. It doesn't really bring attention to itself. It's just there. I wouldn't be able to tell if it was just the surface that was like this or if there was something else. It feels more discreet and more hidden in a way. I would say it's soft, runny. I think maybe a bit cool, not cold, but like a bit of coolness or something like that. Yes, I think it reminds me of skiing somehow.\",\n        \"So this is also pulses. The immediate impression is like a submarine. It feels a bit underwater, a bit gloopy, a bit muffled. It sounds a bit like bubbles. It sounds like I'm hearing medium-sized, manmade metallic structures passing through the water. Ambivalence, but not particularly angst provoking ambivalence but just like ambivalence that's bordering on indifference.\",\n        \"Okay. This one is more chirpy. It's like a little bird just chirping away. Again, it's like the alarm, but a more emergency alarm. It reminds me of a fire alarm, like panic, I guess. It's good. I'm not complaining. It's not like it's giving me a panic right now, but I feel like it in itself is trying to tell me something that I should be aware of.\",\n        \"It feels like there's a pattern to this one, as well as like a vibration but not that it's getting stuck and not like it's ringing either. Not bad because it's quite a familiar feeling rather than a phone ringing. It feels more like there's music playing from the phone, and you can just feel something, but it doesn't feel as intentional. A little bit like a base from a speaker. Consistent.\",\n        \"This is very slight. I'm actually just second-guessing myself if I actually feel something, but I do feel something which is good. This feels more like you have just a glass thing, and someone sprinkles a little bit of sand on it, I think, but just like a tiny bit of sand, not a lot. A bit plain. I don't want to be mean. It's just very plain. Yes, but because I'm moving my finger more, you do feel a little vibration in the background. So maybe the person has layers. Who knows? I like this one. Because the longer I was feeling it, the more I felt, which is nice. It feels good. Yes, but I think it's also maybe a little bit of a nervous speech in the end. I think the longer I'm listening to this like it's something going to happen? It's this build-up, so maybe that's also an emotion.\",\n        \"This one is definitely telling me that something or someone was in a hurry. If I were watching a movie, this would be like the sound that was telling me like this entity is in a hurry. I would say that I feel a pattern in my finger. Again, it's fast, but it's also not that intense. Yes, it's fast. It's not that intense, but it is fast, so it makes me feel like if I were looking at someone that is in a hurry. I would say that it's like a clock that is going too fast, but it's not like a disturbing clock. It's just like a clock in the background that is definitely going fast. That's why I feel that I am in a hurry, but it's not a very disturbing clock. But again, since it is not that intense, it doesn't feel like it's talking to me, but if I were observing what is happening.\",\n        \"It's a very subtle sensation. It's like someone is shaking or shivering, like little impulses which are fractured, but they're really subtle. It's, I don't know, like a small bird which is shivering which I am stroking, or something and the heart is beating fast or something.\",\n        \"Yes, [onomatopoeia]. Yes, this one feels like the electrical balls you had as a child where you had electric feedback. I think we also got from that. You put your hand, and there were like these little lights through your hand. I can't remember what it's called. It feels like a very subtle caress. It feels exploratory, like something new. An adventurer.\",\n        \"It feels smooth again. The surface is even now, and it doesn't feel like it's breaking or slowing me down as much. It's like without obstacles, easier to move through. Again, it's like I'm on the surface of the glass. I'm on the outer.\",\n        \"This feels similar but more friction but not sticky. It's still easy to slide but has more vibration and more feedback than the one before. Now I really feel it. When I swipe across the screen every few centimeters, I get a little bump. The faster I go, the more bumps I get. This also feels maybe like a gallery of pictures of stuff that gives you feedback as soon as you land on the next point of interest. I can't really characterize this as a person, to be honest. Yes, it feels tactile and nice, like haptic feedback to a screen situation or to an event that happens on a screen.\"],\n       [\"This one is hard to tell whether it's the actual vibration or whether it's just my finger on the glass. It's interchangeable. I think it feels like you're waiting for something to happen because it's going smooth and then hits the glass because there's nothing really happening with the vibration. So it's just your finger on the glass. It does remind me of something, actually. It reminds me of the fingerprint button on an iPhone. That's what it is. It's quiet. I would say it feels quite quiet.\",\n        \"I was wondering if this is the one that somebody said sort of feels like farts. I don't know. It doesn't really feel like a fart, but I can feel like something's going on like [onomatopoeia]. It's similar to the last one. But it's a bit more resistance. And I can feel actual specks of dirt. I feel like this glass is dirty. It sort of feels like cleaning a whiteboard, cleaning a window, or at least, what it should feel like when I should have to clean it or something. Gross. I don't know. It's not really gross, but it feels dirty. Sticky. I feel like there are specific parts. Right here, it feels a little bit dirtier than other parts. Maybe that's just me going crazy.\",\n        \"This one feels like it's really hard to actually move it. There's some friction, like little hills. I don't know if I can explain that. Maybe a good way to explain it is like it feels like the glass is getting stuck on my finger, like the little parts, like making a fingerprint. It's uncomfortable. Maybe it feels like there's something on the glass. Someone has spilled something. Yes, it feels like when you spill something in the kitchen and then it's a bit sticky and you try to wipe it away with your finger, and then everything gets nasty. So it's nasty. It makes you feel nasty. It's like something wants my finger to get stuck on the glass. And it probably is going to make a really gross sound if I would hear it.\",\n        \"This is cool. I like this one. This is very interactive, like skipping, going for a walk, like an excited mood, like hopping alone. I don't literally hop when I'm excited and go for walks. I would feel it's something that it reminds me of. Do you remember being a kid and you had those xylophones? It's like a xylophone kind of sensation, really light up-beat. Really interactive. Really playful. Groovy and fun. I'm speaking between the glass, like there's something behind the glass, like someone's communicating through the glass, actually. I don't know.\",\n        \"Okay. This one here feels a little bit more muddy than the other ones, I'd say. In that, the attack, like the onset and the decay, is a little bit weaker than some of the other ones. I would say maybe an engine like a motor that's just running in idle, just standing, being on without actually going anywhere, but just standing there. Or maybe like an old steam train that's just standing there, waiting at the platform ready to go. I would associate it with something that's going in a very uniform pace in the same linear direction. Yes, something that's very syncopated.\",\n        \"Nothing on my first finger. Nothing on second. No, I don't think I'm getting anything again. It's less continuous than the last one, a little bit bumpy, but super, super light once again. Yes, not much to say on it because I can barely feel it. A little bit gravelly.\",\n        \"I think I'm going to change my finger and see because I don't think I'm feeling anything. Yes, it just feels like the glass.\",\n        \"This feels very light, almost like there's no friction at all. My hand is just sliding. It's actually really comfortable. It's really nice. Maybe like soft waves or something because it's very calming. It makes me feel really calm. It's a really nice feeling.\",\n        \"This one's a very light, constant beating. It's like the ticking of a train but a model train, not an actual train. It's a bit hard to associate it with anything except from that. I sense of very light constant beating like a ticking clock or a model train. It's very neutral, just going along, not really sad or angry, just neutral.\",\n        \"Yes, they're little again. They're very small and pretty intense, like [onomatopoeia]. They would be very annoying for a long time. I would say it might be what a migraine feels like, constant pain in your head. It's definitely telling me to get up and do something. It's very demanding. But it's also very quiet. So it might be like your sub-conscience when you're watching something on your phone while you should actually be studying. It makes me feel like there's somebody trying to tell me something here. It makes me feel like the glass is trying to talk to me and tell me to get up to do something. I can sense those little, very tiny electrical shocks, those little vibrations. And then there's a lot of friction in between. So there's a lot of just normal glass and then those little thingies again and again and again. They're pretty frequent.\",\n        \"This is annoying. This is also stressful. It's even more stressful because it's not that significant. It's not very good. It's like I need to pace up. I feel like I need to set up the pace, faster, faster, faster. I feel like I'm in a hurry. I'm running late. Someone who would needs to be on time. You need to make it.\",\n        \"This one's hard to figure out. It doesn't really bring up anything in particular. Aimless. I feel like I'm in a lecture, and I don't understand what he's talking about. I feel small vibrations. They're apparent, but they're weak and very frequent. It reminds me of a train like if I were to hear the chugging of a training. It's starting up. But not a train when it's at full speed. Just like at a train station. It's the sound of the train starting. Machinery.\"],\n       [\"I'm not feeling a whole lot on this one. I don't know if that's because I'm not in the zone. Though, I can feel that it's quite rhythmic. It's not very sharp. It's more soft and more constant and not flowing. Dominance to me is like an oppression thing, and it doesn't feel particularly oppressive. But it also doesn't feel submissive. It's maybe a slightly unnerving thing, really. I don't know. No, it feels quite novel. The only thing it feels a little bit like is when your downstairs neighbor has their washing machine on, and the vibrations are coming up to the floor. But you can't necessarily hear or feel the actual rhythm of it. It's more just the constancy or something. I don't know. Indirect, almost.\",\n        \"The first word that comes to mind is staccato, which is like a musical term, but it feels like a staccato. I don't feel anxious, but it gives me more of an anxious feeling than the previous one. This doesn't feel benign. I don't think I felt anything like this before. I'm not quite sure how it feels.\",\n        \"Yes, this feels very insisting. It feels like it's telling me to stop, but it feels pushy in a way. It's really trying to tell me something. It also feels very physical, I would say. It feels like an object. It doesn't feel electrical, like some of the others. But it feels more like a surface that I'm used to. It's again that I feel like I need to be aware of something. I think it's more that it feels like it wants me to stop moving my finger more than it wants me to be aware of something. I find this more relating to the thing that I'm doing now. I can imagine driving a car and then having a feeling like this in the whole car telling me to slow down, like slow down or stop what you're doing right now. It's not being alert of anything else.\",\n        \"It feels brittle. It feels like a material which doesn't have much substance to it, which feels like glass. It can fracture in many ways but also is quite fine and complexly shaped, fragile. I am stepping on eggshells. I have to be careful here. Stepping on ice. Touching something delicate.\",\n        \"Okay, I can feel something now, I think. It's very subtle, though. It's not really vigorous. It's quite calming, I guess. Very loose. It's just like indents. Yes, indents in the glass. It's not very alarming. It's just subtle.\",\n        \"It feels it feels different on each finger. No, I can't associate it with anything that I've felt before. As you're running your finger across it, you hit a point where you can feel it. And it's like vibrations afterward, and then it fades a bit, and then you can feel again. It's almost like you hit the peak of the sensation, and then it fades a little bit. It feels like there's a texture to it. Almost like you're feeling brail. And that it's bumpy. That's maybe a good way of explaining it. It feels like you're running over individual bumps. It got that much texture to it.\",\n        \"I don't think I like this one. I think if you would visualize it, there would be a lot of flashing lights right now. I don't know why but for some reason. Yes, it's not pleasant. Doesn't feel that nice. I think, with this one, I'm just more tempted to just lift my finger off the glass. I'm like, you know, there's something about it. Yes, I think also just my body --. It's just my fingers like this is --. Something's wrong. I think this one feels just like the other one, more like an electric current. And I'm like, whatever I'm touching is not safe. This is not something you should be touching. So I think a bit of like danger maybe. Or like something is not right.\",\n        \"This one makes me feel as if I were in a hurry for something. I just feel something tickling. I feel that it's a sensation of something touching the tip of my finger, but this time the pattern is almost like a piano song, like the piano part of a song that is a little bit faster. This one is almost like something is coming. It's that part of a song where you have this piano, and then the piano is telling you the next big part of the song is just about to arrive. It's almost like announcing something that is going to happen. Yes, it makes me feel excited when I know that something is just going to happen, and then I am definitely excited because something is going to happen. Just the moment before knowing that you are going to be surprised and amazed. Yes, definitely.\",\n        \"It's like a gallop of some horses [onomatopoeia].

I think in between, there's a little break why it feels like a triplet.\",\n        \"This feels like small bubbles exploding, but it's tiny tiny explosions. Yes, like I'm touching small bubbles, and as my finger goes along, it pops them. Yes, this is kind of fun. I should keep going.\",\n        \"This one is hard to differentiate again. It feels a bit like the last one, where it's almost like the glass is the opposite of being greasy. There's still a lot of friction. It's a bit heavy to move your finger around compared to what you usually sense with a touch display. It's a bit like moving your finger down a window, but your finger is a bit wet, creating this weird kind of friction. Compared to when your fingers dry, it's more smooth more easy to move across, but when it's wet, it sticks a bit, and it breaks more.\",\n        'This feels like if you are walking past a fence and have a stick that you just rattle along the fence. Because there are bumps every now and again but nothing in between, it feels. The faster you go, the faster rattling goes, or the bumps become. This could be something for a wheel or a setting where you can scroll through a lot of values until you land where you need to be. Maybe if you go to a website and you have to select your country of origin. Or you have lots of lots of countries that you scroll through. This feels like the sound it does when you scroll through. Yes, a little bit of hecticness because you can scroll so fast and still feel where you are as if you were in a hurry a bit to find your selection.'],\n       [\"This one feels like I'm using a pencil. I hate using pencils. I've already used the word scratchy, but it also is quite scratchy. It's not very nice. It feels like when you run your finger along a smooth surface, but maybe like a wooden surface. But then there's a bit of wood sticking up, and then it's like a splint, just like that. It just feels uncomfortable, I think.\",\n        \"Okay. The other one was very uniform. This doesn't feel so uniform. It feels like there are some parts where I'm feeling something and where my finger gets caught. It feels dirty again. It feels like glass. It feels like last time, my fingers getting sort of stuck at some point. If I am rubbing, my finger goes flying through. But then, at some point, it feels like I'm getting stuck on something. I don't like it. I don't know. I feel yucky. I feel like I should go wash my hands.\",\n        \"This one feels barely noticeable. I couldn't understand at first that there was some kind of a pattern. It feels like it's just my finger on something sticky or grease. I don't know. Sweat on it or something. It's a bit disruptive. I don't know what to even say about this one. It's not something you would meet, like using a touchscreen in real life, I think. I guess maybe it has this lagging as well. So like when you're at the McDonald's that have these touchscreens, and sometimes they don't work because stupid kids use them too much. And then it's you ordering. That's how it feels. Impatient. Those got damn kids. I just want my burger. But something is not right. I expect smooth sailing.\",\n        \"It almost feels like this sensation is based on the amount of pressure I'm putting on this glass, but I know it's probably not. It almost feels like it's me and not the signal. I'm like in control. I don't know. It feels like it's coming from me because I can't really figure out a pattern or anything. So it messes with my head thinking that if I press harder, I'm going to feel something more. But I'm not. But I am. I don't know. Maybe unsettled. Because I feel like it's me doing something, but it's not me doing something. So I feel like I've lost control when I said the feeling was making me feel in control. But at the end, I'm just feeling insecure about what is happening. At the Science Museum, there's those things with the purple electric lights, and then you come closer to it, and then you can feel it, and then you move away, and you can't feel it. But it's almost with a delayed reaction. That's why I think those sensations are coming from me.\",\n        \"This one here feels like it has a little bit more pattern to it. It's almost rhythmic in a sense. Yes, I would say, for instance, music. For instance, that could be a chord progression or a baseline of something, something that has sort of a rhythm to it that changes. It feels good. I would say it sort of speaks to my brain the same way that hearing a chord progression or a bass line or something like that in music will do, like something that you can follow along to. Yes, that same area of the brain being activated, almost.\",\n        \"Yes, nothing on those two fingers again. It almost feels like it's not as continuous as the last one. The last one was like tiny little footsteps. This is more of like a skip. Like a very faint heartbeat, if you were testing somebody. Quiet because I can barely feel it.

I'm assuming if we can touch electricity, this is how it will probably feel, slight sparks. It makes me think of electric lines like these giant ones in fields. No, just like these radar pulse guns that they use to measure speed, if that makes sense. I don't know. I can definitely feel it beyond just my skin, like I can feel it on my entire finger. It reminds me of EDM somehow, like the bass and reverberating. I don't know, just nice to feel sensations and a little more grounded to the feeling.\",\n        \"This feels like a rough glass surface. It reminds me of the one at the beginning where I felt like I was lightly electrocuted, but at the same time, it feels like there's an uneven structure on the glass. Yes, there's some kind of uneven structure on the glass, but only sometimes, not all the time. It actually mostly reminds me of when I have to lock my phone up, and I can't press the password incorrectly. So it does like this vibration, and it says wrong password. Else I don't think I can attach anything to it.\",\n        \"When I'm moving my finger at this one, it feels like I'm hitting some smudge on a screen or like some pains or something like that. Then I'm smudging it along the path of my finger. It's not really stopping me, but it's something in my way that I'm dragging along. It's not that forceful. It's nicer. It's telling me to keep going, but instead of just letting me go, it's more pushing me along every time I feel it. It's a beating sensation, very periodic. It's a bit happier, more like dancing to beats. It's more like a heartbeat, this one. It gives us two beats and then a longer break.\",\n        \"They're closer together, and they kind of have a rhythm in there. It's like a long-short-short. This one is like it's not on my fingertip but more inside the hand. I guess it goes deeper inside. This one is more annoying than the other ones. Long-short-short, I had to think at the beginning if that was the symbol for SOS. It reminded me of Morse code. It's not. I don't think you need help.

This one feels rough. It feels like I'm touching leather or old skin. It makes me think I'm in a retirement home or an old person's home. There are just people just sitting and doing nothing and being lethargic. They are immobile and sitting still. The only thing I can think of is sitting on the couch, an old couch.\"],\n       [\"I would say it's quite similar to the last one when I said it felt like the fingerprint button on an iPhone. It feels like when you unlock an iPhone with your fingerprint but maybe five times stronger than that, to be specific. It's maybe like an alarm clock. I wouldn't say it reminds me of something I felt before.\",\n        \"It feels like a sensation that I'd feel in some sort of arcade game where something's coming up at me. I'm going to go slower. Yes, it feels like there's some pulsing underneath my finger, but I can't attach it concretely to anything. It feels like one of those spaceship games where it's shooting at you, and then you need to avoid the missiles and shoot back. I'm a little stressed. Not very stressed. It just feels like something's coming up at me, and I don't know what.\",\n        \"This one feels alive. It's good to touch, but you can still feel there is some kind of action happening with whatever I'm interacting with. It's not disruptive. It's not too much in your face, but it gives you enough feedback to understand that you're actually interacting with something. It's a positive thing. Maybe success because it does make you feel like something is happening. Something is working. So it doesn't give you negative feelings that there's an error or there's a lack, or something is wrong like some of the previous ones. But I think it's because it's also continuous and not so much disruptive as a feeling. So it's like a positive one. I think it reminds me of kitchen appliances like any kind of appliances that use batteries or a hairdryer, maybe a mixer, even though a mixer is actually a way more strong vibration. But I think it's like when you hold it in your hand, then you cringe, then the vibration becomes less, and it resembles this one maybe.\",\n        \"This one feels like I'm putting my hands through something not quite as light as water, but something a bit more vicious and just put on my hands through slime. I feel rubbery slime, that kind of bounce back, but also liquid sensation. I'm not sure if I'm really getting a message out of it. It's almost more just the sensation if I was to be playing a game. It'll be more like a fun, playful kind of interaction.\",\n        \"I would say it feels like dance music almost. It has a really high beat frequency if you can call it that. So like fast-paced music. And also because, again, I would say the onset of this one is a little bit higher. So it's more of the thumping sound that it gives off while still being in a high bpm. This is telling me that something is working at a fast pace. Yes, it's definitely attention-grabbing. I can't really specify what or what kind of feelings it brings with it other than it grabs my attention, not in a bad way or not in a good way. It's a neutral way, I'd say. It feels like something you might be drawn to look towards.\",\n        \"Okay, I'm getting this on my pinky for sure. It feels like going over speed bumps. If you were an ant --. That doesn't make any sense. Not a normal person's speed bump --. An ant going over ant-sized speed bumps. Not us going over us-sized speed bumps for some reason. It's very, very small the sensation, but it is bumpy. I like it more than the last one. I didn't love the gaps in the last one. The gaps made me uncomfortable for some reason. It feels like it's bumpy, so I guess there is technically gaps, but obviously, they're closer together. Yes, I could vibe with this one. Yes, but I don't know what. It's really hard to recall sensations. Do you know whenever you start getting your blood taken, and you can feel your blood in your finger? You've got that little thing that clips on.

It's glass, but it kind of does something with you. Yes, a little like electrical shocks, but it doesn't hurt or anything. Yes, it's maybe like a little vibration, like when your smartphone vibrates, but it's somewhere very deep in your pocket, and you just barely feel it. But you have it right on your finger. I think this one is not really calming. The last one was more calming, and this one is more intense, more demanding. It wants me to do something. It's like an alarm clock.\",\n        \"It feels like I'm running. It's relaxing because I'm not running to a place. I'm just running. It's like footsteps, quick footsteps. It's like fast and continuous vibrations or sensations, but it varies. It's like a hard step, and then I'm jumping off again and then a hard step, and then I'm jumping off again. Free time. Enjoying the fresh air. Running in a beautiful landscape. Free. Just do what you need to do to play ahead in some way.\",\n        \"It feels gentle, like I'm petting or touching something or someone like a dog or a person. It gives me the sensation or feeling of caring, I guess. Intimacy. Affection. Love. Appreciation. It's telling me to be soft, to go easy on what I'm touching. I would describe this as purring like a cat.\"],\n       ['[empty]',\n        \"This feels very constant but more like sludgy. I keep thinking, is it my finger that is sweaty? Or is it the thing that is just there all the time? It's annoying me a little bit, but I think it's maybe because I can't quite sense what I am supposed to be sensing. I feel it can't make its mind up, and I can't make my mind up. It doesn't feel like much on my finger.\",\n        \"I'm thinking of jets in a jacuzzi or a spa or something like that, like these small water --. Yes, it feels like water pushing out on me of these small water jets used for massaging. That's the feeling I'm getting from this, like calmness and relaxation, I would say. It's feeling relaxed. I would say going to the swimming pool or going to a spa or something, something leisurely, but something relaxing. I'm not exercising, but I'm relaxing in the water. I think that's what I'm really doing. Maybe going into the sauna after that.\",\n        'It feels a bit similar to the others. It has that slight sweaty feel but much lighter and much thinner. It feels like a small string of droplets, a very tiny string of droplets. Drumming my fingers. The pecking of a small bird. A millipede marching around, a really tiny millipede. Maybe erotic excitement, like that shiver that you get in excitement. Buzzy. Anxious. Light. Indeterminate. Flattery.',\n        'This one is less rhythmic, I think. Erratic.',\n        \"I can't really feel much. No, not really. Just a little bit rough. It's almost like a piece of wood that's just being sanded, so it should be smooth, but it's a little bit not, a little bit more textured than just a smooth piece of wood. It does feel like it doesn't normally feel like this. It feels like this for a reason. It's hardy, a bit rough around the edges. It does remind me of the feeling of sandpaper. It reminds me of my granddad building stuff. It's got the same sort of sensation as a piece of wood or a drawer or something like that.\",\n        \"Okay, so I think because it feels like you're touching a surface which has some lines on them. And sometimes you come back to your line, and then your finger slights over. It's just like stripes. That's how I feel it for a bit. Okay, so is this my birthday? When I had a gift, and the wrapping paper had a pattern on it? So it's a good sensation. I'm unwrapping a gift. I think that's because you feel the thing on the wrapping paper. It's a happy sensation. I think it feels much more normal than the one just before because that was very short. This is much more like I'm just touching any object with, I don't know, a pattern on it. It feels quite normal. I could touch this with my finger every day, like objects or something to the rest. It's not negative, but I also don't love it. It's a bit weird because this kind of thing makes you want to stop your finger. I feel like if there's a rhythm which I can't because that's not allowed. What I feel like, therefore, I'm a bit intrigued because you're trying to disguise a rhythm, but I can't.\",\n        \"Maybe this is going to sound weird, but this reminds me of the beginning of a salsa song. In the beginning, it's like, you have a rhythm in the beginning and then one last part that is like [onomatopoeia]. It reminds me of the beginning of --. Well, it's not the beginning of a salsa song, but it's like one of those parts in any salsa song when you have some musical instruments that play one last part, and then you have silence, and then all the orchestra comes with the last hit in that part of the song. It makes me feel a little bit amazed. Yes, amazed. That sound, that empty step in the middle, is almost left in the room empty, and then there's something big coming in. It's a pattern that is definitely a periodic pattern, but it has more parts now. In the beginning, it's like two patterns super fast, then two patterns super fast again, then a silent, and then two beats that are longer and consecutive.\",\n        \"You can feel very subtle impulses. They're really fast and then three slower impulses. It's not a big difference to the glass plate without any patterns. It's like when I'm afraid to tell something. That's what I feel in my body, like little shakes before I tell the truth or I don't know. I think what I said.\",\n        \"This one is harder to describe. Maybe a small pinching. I'm going in the wrong direction or something. Like a low-frequency pitch, I think.\",\n        \"It makes me feel fresh like I just woke up in the morning. It's hard to describe. It's like all the thoughts and processes in your brain haven't really come during the day, so you're empty-minded almost.\",\n        \"This feels more as there are intervals between vibrations, maybe like swiping through a gallery of images, and each vibration would be a new picture. Ever-changing. It feels like it's going on and off. But not in a bad way. It still feels nice. It doesn't really get sticky. It just still allows you to swipe, but it gives you some feedback every now and again.\"],\n       [\"This one is like a frog croaking. It feels scary, actually. Because the vibrations are quite low, and they get faster. It feels like your fingers are being chased. I don't know if it does remind me of anything from before. It is quite intense, quite dominating, quite rough as well.\",\n        \"Yes, it feels like little vibrations, but I don't know how to describe it. It's like [onomatopoeia]. It feels like tiny little bristles like very, very small ones that I'm running my finger down, maybe sort of like a toothbrush. It still feels a little bit dirty in some places. I'm wondering if that's just me. It's like a lot of bumps that are soft. They're kind of hard. But they're very, very thin and it's a lot of them. It feels like you're lightly touching a toothbrush like the bristles. I don't know. I don't mind it. It feels fun to touch.\",\n        \"That one actually feels good, a bit, for example, like a purring cat. But it also feels like I'm actually doing an action like moving my finger. It actually gives some kind of results. I'm drawing some shapes. It's a good feeling. It doesn't feel like a disruption. I think it's because it's prolonged. I don't see that as a person at all. I see it more like I'm doing art, more of an action. If I had to describe it may be fun, creative. But that's because right now, it gives in my head this imagery of I'm doing art. And I'm making this fun collage or a painting or something. So it might be biased. Purring. Fun. Creative. Colorful. Yes, fun. This is fun. It actually feels nice.\",\n        \"This is a little bit more electric. Maybe a bit anxious, just because it's a bit more of an electric feeling. The gaps between the sensation are further apart. So it's making me feel a bit almost like the sensation shouldn't be there on the glass, but it is. And it's almost like I touched it, and it's a bit electric, and that's weird.\",\n        \"Sharpness. More needles stabbing. It's like this prickly sensation if your hairs start to rise in the back of your neck, sort of feeling, I would say. I don't know. Getting kissed in the back of the neck or something. I don't know. It's like this weird space between pleasure and pain. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's a clearly nice or pleasant feeling, but yet still, it's very distinct. I'm not going to say it's painful or anything because it's not, but it's just very stabby. I don't know. It causes arousal in some way.\",\n        'No, not much going on with first or second. No. Feels like maybe there is a very, very light, similar to one of the ones from the first half, like very continuous buzz, but very very light once again. Or is it continuous? Yes, not much happening there but just very, very light buzz. ',\n        \"Yes, this feels like it's pulling me towards it. I don't know. Yes, the more vibration that sort of sucks you in. It's like falling from the sky and in the gravity acts on you. It feels like little buzzes on my finger. I don't know, not particularly. It feels like when I'm doing a curl or something like that. It's like when you're painting, and you want to do a full stop. This feels like a nice full stop. I don't know, a little eccentric, and maybe it would be a little quirky, would say things directly. Yes, sometimes when you just want to not be politically correct and just say whatever you want to say.\",\n        \"This also feels like increased friction some of the time. I feel like I'm attached to the screen, but not constantly but some of the time. I feel my finger is getting stuck more to the screen. It's like a tingling sensation on my finger, but it also feels like I have something on my finger that attaches me to the screen. I guess it kind of reminds me of touching a really cold window with your finger, and then it being more attached when you have to take it off. Like a really needy person who has a hard time letting go.\",\n        \"This one feels angry, like it wants me to stop moving. It's also a bit random, a bit crazy, a bit out of control. I sense, I think, if I've before sensed pebbles, I'm more sense like heavier rocks now, or like maracas music instruments or something like that. It makes me feel a bit more annoyed because it feels like it's working against me and not with me. This is an angry person, a forceful person, but, yes, angry.\",\n        \"They don't have a pattern that much. They're pretty much random. They have different lengths. They're all more or less of the same intensity, I would say. But I can't figure out a pattern with them. It's I can sense the friction. So I can sense a lot of friction, and then I move, and then it completely vanishes for a while. And then, at a random point, there's a lot of friction again. It's like tiny earthquakes. It's a little unsafe because you can't in any way control it or know what's happening. So if this was the feeling I had in a room, it would not be good. No, I can't associate any actions with it because they're so random. So there seems to be, even if you move it in the same way, the sensations won't be at the same place or anything. So it's not like you can control it in any way. It's just a surprise what's happening every time you move your finger.\",\n        \"I feel like it's trying to tell me something. Stop, but you need to go somewhere else and something like that. Stop, but you need to go somewhere else, and then it's trying to explain where to go. I want to understand what is being said because it bounces up and down. It's okay. It's significant. I guess someone who is trying to understand a friend who's telling me something or a colleague or someone. Wants to be understood.\",\n        \"It just feels like, I guess, concentration. You're focusing on something, but you can't figure it out. You're not there. You just aren't getting it. Someone who is unsure. They are non-committal. It feels like rubber, like glass most of the time. If you're are to rub the bottom of your shoe, it feels like rubber, like a very squeaky rough feeling.\"],\n       [\"See, this one feels a bit stronger. Yes, excited. And yes, I suppose I do feel satisfied. Yes, I mean, the actual sensation of itself is quite nice. And again, it's not super strong. It's really quite pleasing. And it's like when you used to have TVs way back in the day. They would have static on them when you touch the screen. It feels like that, but maybe 10 percent of that. So it feels definitely not natural. It's a technological feeling. I don't know. It's an alien feeling. And so things I felt before is a little bit like the TV thing. I don't know. It kind of feels like you might be away to get a massage or something, and they start you off with this.\",\n        \"It's like a vibrator, but one that's not very powerful, just very low level. It's funny to me. It's slightly exciting as well, not necessarily sexually exciting, but like that buzz of excitement. No, I don't feel bored. I feel very in my head, exciting, mysterious, a little bit anxious.\",\n        \"Yes, this feels like an electric pulse, like a small electric outlet. It feels a little bit tingly. I don't know. It feels like something I felt before, but I can't really place where it is. It feels electrical. No, I don't think I can associate any actions with this. I don't know. I'm thinking of some therapeutic stuff or maybe a massage or something like that, like sitting in a massage chair or something like that.\",\n        \"This feels like lots of small balls. There's just a lot of balls falling, small balls falling. It reminds me of a lottery where you have little balls running around. And then they all fall down towards the end. I guess a sense of falling. It could be a joyous occasion of sorts, like a party. You're at a party. The champagne is flowing. People are chatting. There's a bubbliness in the air. It just feels like lots of smooth surfaces intermittently making contact with my finger, just like [onomatopoeia], a bit like those metal pin things which you put in your face and you can make your face --. Imagine all those pins just randomly come into contact with your finger.\",\n        \"I don't know. Again, it's not as urgent or aggressive. I feel like I'm touching on the surface of a machine, and you can feel the machinery working within it. You're not touching it directly, but it's more on the surface. If I was to be stroking maybe the outside of a car, and you can feel the engine in it. And you're just touching the surface of it. That's what I could imagine, what it would feel like to feel the outside of a car. So I guess I've done that.\",\n        \"This is a bit like perspex glass. It's a little bit plasticky. I don't know if that makes sense. It's almost a bit dryer. It's not very pleasant. I don't particularly like the feeling. It's like when you're unpacking boxes or something. It's got that same sort of sensation. Yes, I'm not that great. It's like if I wouldn't want to voluntarily touch it. I think it would rather just be something that you would run your hands over and go. Take your hands off, or at least I would.\",\n        \"Okay, this feels more like the one from just now but then without like the Jars thing behind it. So like you just took away a layer or something in a way. This feels much more normal. It's just like a rough surface you're touching. I'm trying to see if I can come up with a better example than wrapping paper. No, it's a bit more rough. It's more a bit unshaven but very slight subtle. I feel very slight. It's not bad. It's not like a stubble that's very prickly. It's a very slight stubble. It feels normal. It's not even an object. It's like another person. It's nice. It's intimate because you're touching someone's stubble, like someone's face. Yes, so it's much more intimate. Someone has not just shaved, but I feel like it's tunnel vision now. It's nice. I think it reminds me more of my dad, maybe in that way.\",\n        \"This one is too long. It's too long. It's the same sensation for a lot of time. Yes, it reminds me of someone farting and then farting forever or working forever or a car making a sound that is not necessarily something where you would feel pleasure, and it goes forever. It is someone that is nasty. Someone is burping for a lot of time or farting for a lot of time or a truck driver but a nasty truck driver honking the klaxon for a lot of time. On my finger, I feel, I would say, that almost noise, and it's the same thing over and over again. It's just like a very long, long sound but in my finger.\",\n        \"That reminds me of a high-pressure sand machine which I hear from afar. It's not really rough and strong and close. It's like I'm on a construction place, and I hear this high-pressure sand machine. It's a little fractured, the sensation, but as sand and stone would come out of the machine, something like this. It's actually quite calm and similar to the white noise I'm listening to. It's like the 3D to my sound on my earphones right now. Chill out. It's okay.\",\n        \"Taking your hand through grass. It's pleasant. It's a pleasant feeling, very light also, very free, not restrained, yes.\",\n        \"It's like touching something that's whole new, unused almost. When you have something of glass, and you pull the first plastic film layer off, and it's still a bit sticky. That's almost what it feels like.\",\n        \"Now it feels like my fingers are wet. Yes, it totally feels like my fingers are wet on a smooth surface. Maybe that is if I would have too sticky hands or too greasy fingers, maybe, going over a smooth surface. I'm feeling breezy. It's hard to say. It wouldn't feel like nice skin. Maybe after sport, exercise, maybe? Yes.\"],\n       [\"This one's very urgent. I can really feel this. The others you're having to think about more. It's not sharp. The best word I can come up with is urgent. This feels like really an alarm. It's like no longer being gently woken up. It's like it's 8:15. Get out of bed, like a fire alarm or something important. And it doesn't feel dissatisfying. I mean, it's like, as I said, I feel like an alarm. This feels like you're actions afoot, whereas some of the other ones have been more like soothing or nice on the finger. But this has also been my favorite of them. No, I don't feel bored. The others have felt more familiar. This feels different. I don't know if it reminds me of something that I have felt before. No, not as much like. The other ones have felt more like this is this sensation. It's somewhere back in my deep brain, whereas this one reminds me of things I've experienced before. I just mentioned alarms or things like that. But it doesn't so much remind me of a tactile sensation.\",\n        \"This is the toughest when you send it to the max level, the vibrator. Sorry for the audio. It makes me think a little bit of standing on the deck of a ferry when it starts moving, and you're surprised by how much you feel the vibration. I feel a little bit distressed. Yes, it feels a bit dominant. It's taking over a little bit. So it's more difficult to think because it's stressing me out.\",\n        \"This one is really annoying, I think. It's really holding me back. It's in the way. It's biking across cobblestone. I don't know. It's not like it's stopping me, but it's really an inconvenience, like really saying, slow down, take it easy, stop, at least tone down what you're doing. I feel like I want to get away from this sensation. I don't want it to get worse. So I want to slow down at least until I can get away from this. It doesn't feel electrical. It feels very physical, very much like a hard surface, like a real everything. It feels very forceful. It's a lot of force. It's feeling like my finger is skipping over stuff. It's running over stuff. I'm just jumping up and down. It feels like the most friction yet. And it's just making my finger jump up and down.\",\n        \"It's undulating. I can sense something trailing behind me. There's a primary fuzz, and then it trails behind and somehow. It feels like a few different points of contact were sparkles of it. So it's slightly sparkly, a bit like the crackling of sparks. Mystical. With some depth. A charming guy. Deep voice. Wonder, I think, is something. Deep thought. Introspection. Slowness. Calm.\",\n        \"Okay. It's not as obvious. Yes, this is the vibrator one. This is the one that is the vibrator. Yes, because it's subtle, but there is a motor inside of it. And in my head, there is a vibrator. Cool. I don't know what it's telling me. I guess I'm just thinking about vibrators now. I don't know what a vibrator would tell me. Pleasure, I guess. Getting off. Sensual sensuality.\",\n        \"Okay. This is even worse. That's just like the last one, but just better. It feels like my phone's vibrating, but I've just got my hand on it. I've got a phone call coming through, and it's got one of those annoying ringtones where it's ringing constantly. And there's a vibration setting on. Yes, I mean, all I can think of is a phone because it feels like a vibration. I find that question really hard when you try to feel it. I don't know. Adjectives don't spring to mind. It feels a lot more urgent than the last ones. It feels like I'm supposed to be doing something, and I'm ignoring it.\",\n        \"This one is weird because already when we were practicing, this one makes me want to push on the glass thing because I feel like there's more resistance, but then I know that's not allowed. I think if we're talking about emotions just now --. Also, I think I just screamed when it just came on. I don't think it's more of resistance. It is not necessarily a positive thing. Because also, during practice, I was like, it's a funny feeling because I would expect to hear a sound when I touch something like this, which I'm not hearing at the moment. And I think it's also one of the things, if I would be touching this, I would stop. I realized, you know what. This is not something that is nice to patch or something. If this would have been like the skin of a pet, I'd be like, no, it's fine. It's a lot. I think, also in relation to the other one, it's very, I don't know, abrupt. I feel like my finger is overwhelmed, but it's also pretty constant.\",\n        \"I feel that I am in a car right now, passing to a bumpy road. Yes, if I were in a car, I would feel this with all my body, but right now, I'm only feeling it with the tip of my finger. It is that. I am in a car, and the road is super bumpy, and everything is shaking a lot. The adjective is bumpy, like a road that is quite bumpy. It makes me feel happy, like part of the adventure. If I am in a car and I know that I'm on a bumpy road because you are doing something definitely out of the city. The thing is that the only bumpy roads that I know are in places that are sunny, so it also reminds me of a sunny place. Yes, in my skin, it is like if I have my hands on a wheel, and it's like the wheel of a car that is like going on a bumpy road. That is what I feel in my skin. Yes, it's telling me that we are not on a very fancy road at this moment. It's telling me this is not a fancy moment.\",\n        \"You can actually see the vibration on my finger. It's like holding a jackhammer in my hands, powerful. It shows me that my fingers are a little ticklish. It's like holding a jackhammer in my hands.\",\n        \"Yes, I can definitely feel this one. It feels like tiny bubble wraps. That's like different fields over the texture. It's fun. It feels pleasant. Yes, I'm enjoying it. Yes, it's softer, like taking my finger and putting it or stroking some sandpaper, but it's way softer than sandpaper. So it feels pleasant, actually. It's a very mellow, chill person.\",\n        \"This feels more bumpy, definitely. It's unsmooth, like it's not what you expect when you move your finger across the glass. It doesn't feel flat at all. It would be somebody that you could discuss a lot with that you may or might not always agree with. Like you can have a lot of differences of opinion but not in a harsh way. It's a bit funny. It makes me feel like longing after doing things on surfaces that remind me of this wavy kind of thing like going swimming or going skiing or going cross biking or mountain biking.\",\n        \"This feels very, very high resistance in each bump. It feels like a sound you hear when you scroll through a library of pictures on an iPhone very fast. That rattling noise that you get if you try to scroll quickly by 500 pictures or 100 pictures at once. This is what this feels like, the sounds. I'm gliding over a lot of content, maybe. This is nice. I like this one. Working quickly, like a quick-thinking person. I'm getting a lot of stuff or looking through a lot of stuff and getting a lot of stuff done, maybe. This was it feels like, like a high frequency of medium-size things that are being done and worked over. It feels like medium-size bumps or not-so-small bumps. I can really feel them. And pretty close to each other. When I go over the surface, I would say, every five millimeters, there's a big bump or a medium-size bump.
